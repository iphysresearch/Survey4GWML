# 2. General Reports & Reviews

>Modern deep learning methods have entered the field of physics which can be tasked with **learning physics from raw data when no good mathematical models are available**. They are also part of mathematical model and machine learning hybrids, formed to reduce computational costs by having the mathematical model train a machine learning model to perform its job, or to improve the fit with observations in settings where the mathematical model can’t incorporate all details (think noise).

# 3. Improving Data Quality

Machine learning techniques have proved to be powerful tools in analyzing complex problems by learning from large example datasets. They have been applied in GW science from as early as **[Lightman et al. (2006) [@lightman2006prospects] (JPCS)]** to the study of glitches  **[Essick et al. (2013) [@2013EssickOptimizingvetoesgravitationalwave] (CQG); Biswas et al. (2013) [@biswas2013application] (PRD)]** and other problems, such as signal characterization  **[Baker et al. (2015) [@baker2015multivariate] (PRD)]** . For example, Gstlal-iDQ **[Vaulin et al. (2013) [@2013RuslanVauliniDQRealTime]]** (a streaming machine learning pipeline based on **[Essick et al. (2013) [@2013EssickOptimizingvetoesgravitationalwave] (CQG)]** and **[Biswas et al. (2013) [@biswas2013application] (PRD)]** reported the probability that there was a glitch in $h(t)$ based on the presence of glitches in witness sensors at the time of the event. In O2, iDQ was used to vet unmodeled low-latency pipeline triggers automatically. 


## Glitch Classification

Some glitches occur only in the GW data channel. We can try and eliminate them by classifying them into different types to help identify their origin. Unfortunately, there is a number of identified classes of glitches for which mitigation methods are not yet understood. For these glitch classes, understanding how searches can separate instrumental transients from similar astrophysical signals is the highest priority **[Davis et al. (2020) [@davis2020utilizing] (CQG)]**.

- PCA based
    - Early ML studies for glitch classification used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). (See **[Powell et al. (2015) [@powell2015classification] (CQG)]** test on simulated data & **[Powell et al. (2017) [@powell2017classification] (CQG)]** test on real data). A trigger generator finds the glitches. The time series of whitened glitches are stored in a matrix D on which PCA is performed. See more on **[Powell (2017) [@powell2017model] (PhD Thesis); Cuoco (2018) [@cuoco2018strategy] (Workshop)]**
    
    - PCA is an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms a set of correlated variables into another set of linearly uncorrelated variables, called Principal Components (PCs).  The matrix $D$ is factored so that $D= U\Sigma V^T$ where $V=A^TA$, $\Sigma$ contains eigenvalues, and $U$ is the PCs. PC coefficients are calculated by taking the dot product of the PCs and the whitened glitch. Then GMM clustering is applied to the PC coefficients. These studies were then improved with the use of Neural Networks.

- CNN (Images feature)

    - **[Razzano & Cuoco 2018 [@razzano2018image] (CQG)]** apply a CNN to simulated glitches. They build images that cover 2 seconds around each glitch from the whitened time series. Simulated six families of signals. Training, validation, and test set with ratio 70:15:15.  Accuracy in the order of ≈98-99% on multiclass classification 
    - **[George et al. (2018) [@george2018classification] (PRD)]**: “Deep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits Convolutional Neural Networks to classify glitches starting from their time frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization.”

## Waveform Modelling

Signal models are needed for matched filtering and parameter estimation. Solutions of the Einstein equations can be obtained with numerical relativity simulations - High computational cost! LIGO and Virgo rely on approximate solutions obtained through phenomenological modelling. Gaussian process regression has been used to produce new waveforms by providing a direct interpolation between numerical simulations. For Example, **[Docter et al. (2017) [@Doctor2017csx] (PRD)]**

- Machine Learning for waveform generation: Use optimal waveform generators, i.e., machine learning models trained with numerical relativity waveforms **[Blackman et al. (2017) [@Blackman2017dfb] (PRD); Huerta et al. (2018) [@Huerta2017kez] (PRD)]** (For eccentric black hole mergers **[Varma et al. (2019) [@Varma2018mmi] (PRD); Varma et al.

## Signal Detection (BBHs)

>

- Matched filter searches:

    * Searches for gravitational wave signals from compact binaries use matched filtering. GW detector noise is non-Stationary and non-Gaussian.
    * Discrete template bank is built to cover the mass-spin parameter space for potential sources. Density of the bank is determined by the minimum overlap requirement of 0.97 so only 3% of SNR is lost. Assume spins are aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Do not account for tidal deformability of neutron stars.
    * Existing matched filtering searches are close to optimal and quite fast (~1 min latency): Matched filtering is very close to optimal sensitivity; Not all of the parameter space is covered; Non-Gaussian noise is well understood;
    * ML searches can help if they are fast and do as well on detector noise artefacts.
>

- Machine learning CBC searches:

    Binary black holes are easy but binary neutron stars are hard - they are longer in duration and broader in bandwidth; Spin (with precession) and eccentricity expand the parameter space; Point estimate parameter estimation is useless - sorry to be harsh; The background estimation problem - a long standing issue that people feel quite strongly about;  

    - **[George & Huerta (2018) [@2018GeorgeDeepNeuralNetworks] (PRD)]** use a system of two deep convolutional neural networks to rapidly detect CBC signals. They use time series as input so that they can find signals too small for image recognition. They find their method significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster.

        - Deep learning for real-time classification and regression of gravitational waves in real advanced LIGO noise. **[George & Huerta (2018) [@George2017pmj] (PLB) [@2017GeorgeDeepLearningRealtime] (1711.07966); George & Huerta (2018) [@George2017vlv] (NiPS Summer School)]**
        - Deep learning at scale for real-time gravitational wave parameter estimation and tests of general relativity **[Shen et al. (2019) [@2021ShenStatisticallyinformedDeep] (Mach. learn.: sci. technol.)].** First Bayesian Neural Network model at scale to characterize a 4-D signal manifold with 10M+ templates. Trained with over ten million waveforms using 1024 nodes (64 processors/node) on an HPC platform optimized for deep learning researches (Theta at Argonne National Lab). Inference time is 2 milliseconds for each gravitational wave detection using a single GPU.
    - **[Gabbard et al. (2018) [@2018GabbardMatchingMatchedFiltering] (PRL)]** also perform a CBC search with a basic and standard CNN network to learn to classify between noise and signal+noise classes. They use whitened time series of measured gravitational-wave strain as an input. Train and test on simulated binary black hole signals in synthetic Gaussian LIGO noise. They find they can reproduce the sensitivity of a matched filter search. i.e. the CNN approach can achieve the same sensitivity as a matched filtering analysis.

    - LIGO & Virgo provide two probabilities in low-latency. **[Chatterjee et al. (2020) [@chatterjee2020machine] (ApJ)]** The probability that there is a neutron star in the CBC system, P(HasNS). The probability that there exists tidally disrupted matter outside the final coalesced object after the merger, P(HasRemnant). Matched filter searches give point estimates of mass and spin but they have large errors! To solve this a machine learning classification is used. (scikit learn K nearest neighbours, also tried random forest). A training set is created by injecting fake signals into gravitational wave data and performing a search. This then produces a map between true values and matched filter search point estimates which is learnt by the classifier.

## Parameter Estimation (PE)

Characterized by 15 parameters. Masses, spins, distance, inclination, sky position, polarization. LIGO & Virgo GWTC-1 **[Abbott et al. (2019) [@abbott2019gwtc] (PRX)]** . Bayes' Theorem ([LAAC tutorial 2019 - Virginia d'Emilio](https://git.ligo.org/virginia.demilio/pe-tutorial-laac19))
>

* MCMC and Nested Sampling
  
    * We have two main PE codes LALInference and Bilby. MCMC Random steps are taken in parameter space, according to a proposal distribution, and accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Nested sampling can also compute evidences for model selection. **[Skilling (2006) [@skilling2006nested] (Bayesian Anal.)]**

* Machine Learning Parameter Estimation

    * **The current “holy grail” of machine learning for GWs.**
    * BAMBI: blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference combines the benefits of nested sampling and artificial neural networks. **[Graff et al. (2012) [@graff2012bambi] (Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc.)]** An artificial neural network learns the likelihood function to increase significantly the speed of the analysis. **[Graff (2012) [@graff2012bayesian] (PhD Thesis)]**
    * Chua et al. **[Chua & Vallisneri (2020) [@chua2020learning] (PRL)]** produce Bayesian posteriors using neural networks.
    * Gabbard et al. **[Gabbard et al. (2019) [@2021GabbardBayesianParameterEstimation] (Nature Physics)]** use a conditional variational autoencoder pre-trained on binary black hole signals. We use a variation inference approach to produce samples from the posterior. It does NOT need to be trained on precomputed posteriors. It is ~6 orders of magnitude faster than existing sampling techniques. For Chris Messenger, it seems completely obvious that all data analysis will be ML in 5-10 years.

## Population Studies

- **[Vinciguerra et al. (2017) [@vinciguerra2017enhancing] (CQG)]** - Enhancing the significance of gravitational wave bursts through signal classification
- Now that we have started to detect a population of black hole signals we can try to do population studies to try and understand signals formation mechanisms. Population properties paper from O1+02 **[Abbott et al. (2019) [@abbott2019binary] (ApJ)]** . Uses phenomenological models (like power laws) combined with Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Bayesian hierarchical modelling involves some assumptions of populations mass and spin distributions.  Does not scale well for high dimensional models and a large number of GW detections. 
* We can use unmodelling clustering! In **[Powell et al. (2019) [@powell2019unmodelled] (Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc.)]** we apply unmodelled clustering to masses and spins. Two of the populations have identical mass distributions and different spin. This is difficult because spin is poorly measured. Determine the number of populations and the number of CBC signals in each population.
* (How do I try it myself?) The Gravitational Wave Open Science Center has the data, parameter estimates, and matched filtering tutorials that you can download. You can get [code](https://git.ligo.org/daniel.wysocki/synthetic-PE-posteriors) to produce synthetic parameter estimates for compact binaries.

# 5. Continuous Wave Search

- Existing challenges and signal characteristics: Vast parameter space, The parameter space is incredibly large; Likely very weak signals, The signal is incredibly weak - orders of magnitude lower than the noise amplitude;  Leading to traditional searches optimised at fixed computational cost - Generally slow, The dataset is (quite) large, 1year X 1kHz =~10 GB; In the era of open data the LVC and competitors are keen to analyse the data very quickly; Narrow band, However, since we have been limited until now by computational expense - with ML this could no longer be a limit, and hence sensitivity can really improve

# 6. Gravitational Wave Bursts

A burst is a gravitational wave signal where the waveform morphology is partially or completely unknown. The source could be an unknown unknown, a supernova, cosmic string, fast radio burst, compact binaries and others. The main burst search is called coherent Wave Burst (cWB).
>

* Coherent Wave Burst (cWB) [Website](https://gwburst.gitlab.io/)
  
    cWB relies upon the excess coherent power in a network of detectors. The data is transformed into time-frequency domain and the clusters of time-frequency pixels above certain energy threshold are identified for each detector. Time frequency map of the single detectors is then combined using the maximisation of the likelihood over all possible sky locations and the events are then ranked according to this likelihood. We can also inform our un-modelled search about the morphology of the expected signal. cWB produces reconstructions of gravitational wave signals. It can detect CBC signals as well as bursts.

* BayesWave

    BayesWave is another standard burst tool. **[Cornish & Littenberg (2015) [@Cornish2014kda] (CQG)]** Models signals as a variable number of sine-Gaussian wavelets with power coherent across detectors. It produces unmodelled waveform reconstructions and can remove glitches that occur during signals. **[Pankow et al. (2018) [@Pankow2018qpo] (PRD)]**
>

* Supernova Search

    Some burst searches are for targeted sources like supernovae. There is not enough supernova waveforms to match filter search but some supernova waveform features are known. The known features from supernova simulations can be incorporated into supernova searches using machine learning.
    
    - **[Astone et al. (2018) [@astone2018new] (PRD)]** enhance the efficiency of cWB using a neural network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that represent the g-mode emission in supernova waveforms. They use cWB to prepare images of the data. They use colours to determine which detectors find the signal. They find their method increases the sensitivity of traditional cWB.
    - **[Iess et al. (2020) [@Iess2020yqj] (Mach. learn.: sci. technol.)]** have a different approach that does not involve cWB. They use a trigger generator called WDF to find excess power in the detector. Then they do a neural network classification to decide if the trigger is a signal or noise. They train directly on supernova waveforms. They use both time series and images of data. They obtain high accuracies with both methods and include glitches.
    - **[Chan et al. (2019) [@Chan2019fuz] (PRD)]** also train directly on supernova waveforms.  They use only the time series waveforms from different explosion mechanisms.

* Burst analysis

    Jordan McGinn. Thesis: "Generalised gravitational burst searches with Generative Adversarial Networks". Examined the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate and interpret large quantities of time-series data. The method was successful in classifying signal data buried within external noise. 

    Uses Generative Adversarial network (GAN) to learn how to make standard burst waveforms. Generation stage has the possibility to make signals spanning all training classes. Discriminator stage has the potential to be a general transient detection tool

* Single Detector Search
  
    30% of gravitational wave data is collected when only 1 detector is in observing mode. Can’t do time slides to measure the background if there is only 1 detector. 

    * **[Cavaglia et al. (2020) [@Cavaglia2020qzp] (Mach. learn.: sci. technol.)]** use machine learning combined with cWB to perform a single detector search for supernovae. They train a genetic programming algorithm on the output parameters of cWB.
    * (How can I try it myself?) You can download some supernova gravitational wave signals [here](http://www.phys.utk.edu/smc/data.html) . You can get KarooGP [here ](http://kstaats.github.io/karoo_gp/). You can get Coherent WaveBurst [here](https://gwburst.gitlab.io/).
