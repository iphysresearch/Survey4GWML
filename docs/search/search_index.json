General Reports & Reviews \u00b6 Modern deep learning methods have entered the field of physics which can be tasked with learning physics from raw data when no good mathematical models are available . They are also part of mathematical model and machine learning hybrids, formed to reduce computational costs by having the mathematical model train a machine learning model to perform its job, or to improve the fit with observations in settings where the mathematical model can\u2019t incorporate all details (think noise).

Improving Data Quality \u00b6 Machine learning techniques have proved to be powerful tools in analyzing complex problems by learning from large example datasets. They have been applied in GW science from as early as [Lightman et al. (2006) 23 (JPCS)] to the study of glitches [Essick et al. (2013) 24 (CQG); Biswas et al. (2013) 25 (PRD)] and other problems, such as signal characterization [Baker et al. (2015) 26 (PRD)] . For example, Gstlal-iDQ [Vaulin et al. (2013) 27 ] (a streaming machine learning pipeline based on [Essick et al. (2013) 24 (CQG)] and [Biswas et al. (2013) 25 (PRD)] reported the probability that there was a glitch in h(t) h(t) based on the presence of glitches in witness sensors at the time of the event. In O2, iDQ was used to vet unmodeled low-latency pipeline triggers automatically. Glitch Classification \u00b6 Some glitches occur only in the GW data channel. We can try and eliminate them by classifying them into different types to help identify their origin. Unfortunately, there is a number of identified classes of glitches for which mitigation methods are not yet understood. For these glitch classes, understanding how searches can separate instrumental transients from similar astrophysical signals is the highest priority [Davis et al. (2020) 28 (CQG)] . PCA based Early ML studies for glitch classification used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). (See [Powell et al. (2015) 29 (CQG)] test on simulated data & [Powell et al. (2017) 30 (CQG)] test on real data). A trigger generator finds the glitches. The time series of whitened glitches are stored in a matrix D on which PCA is performed. See more on [Powell (2017) 31 (PhD Thesis); Cuoco (2018) 32 (Workshop)] PCA is an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms a set of correlated variables into another set of linearly uncorrelated variables, called Principal Components (PCs). The matrix D D is factored so that D= U\\Sigma V^T D= U\\Sigma V^T where V=A^TA V=A^TA , \\Sigma \\Sigma contains eigenvalues, and U U is the PCs. PC coefficients are calculated by taking the dot product of the PCs and the whitened glitch. Then GMM clustering is applied to the PC coefficients. These studies were then improved with the use of Neural Networks. CNN (Images feature) [Razzano & Cuoco 2018 33 (CQG)] apply a CNN to simulated glitches. They build images that cover 2 seconds around each glitch from the whitened time series. Simulated six families of signals. Training, validation, and test set with ratio 70:15:15. Accuracy in the order of \u224898-99% on multiclass classification [George et al. (2018) 34 (PRD)] : \u201cDeep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits Convolutional Neural Networks to classify glitches starting from their time frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization.\u201d Wavelet-based (Time series feature) [Cuoco et al.

GW detector noise is non-Stationary and non-Gaussian. Discrete template bank is built to cover the mass-spin parameter space for potential sources. Density of the bank is determined by the minimum overlap requirement of 0.97 so only 3% of SNR is lost. Assume spins are aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Do not account for tidal deformability of neutron stars. Existing matched filtering searches are close to optimal and quite fast (~1 min latency): Matched filtering is very close to optimal sensitivity; Not all of the parameter space is covered; Non-Gaussian noise is well understood; ML searches can help if they are fast and do as well on detector noise artefacts. Machine learning CBC searches: Binary black holes are easy but binary neutron stars are hard - they are longer in duration and broader in bandwidth; Spin (with precession) and eccentricity expand the parameter space; Point estimate parameter estimation is useless - sorry to be harsh; The background estimation problem - a long standing issue that people feel quite strongly about; [George & Huerta (2018) 125 (PRD)] use a system of two deep convolutional neural networks to rapidly detect CBC signals. They use time series as input so that they can find signals too small for image recognition. They find their method significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster.

Bayesian hierarchical modelling involves some assumptions of populations mass and spin distributions. Does not scale well for high dimensional models and a large number of GW detections. We can use unmodelling clustering! In [Powell et al. (2019) 284 (Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc.)] we apply unmodelled clustering to masses and spins. Two of the populations have identical mass distributions and different spin. This is difficult because spin is poorly measured.

Gravitational Wave Bursts \u00b6 A burst is a gravitational wave signal where the waveform morphology is partially or completely unknown. The source could be an unknown unknown, a supernova, cosmic string, fast radio burst, compact binaries and others. The main burst search is called coherent Wave Burst (cWB). Coherent Wave Burst (cWB) Website cWB relies upon the excess coherent power in a network of detectors. The data is transformed into time-frequency domain and the clusters of time-frequency pixels above certain energy threshold are identified for each detector. Time frequency map of the single detectors is then combined using the maximisation of the likelihood over all possible sky locations and the events are then ranked according to this likelihood. We can also inform our un-modelled search about the morphology of the expected signal. cWB produces reconstructions of gravitational wave signals. It can detect CBC signals as well as bursts. - [Drago et al. (2020) 336 (2006.12604)] - Coherent Waveburst, a Pipeline for Unmodeled Gravitational-wave Data Analysis - [Mishra et al.

[Cornish & Littenberg (2015) 339 (CQG)] Models signals as a variable number of sine-Gaussian wavelets with power coherent across detectors. It produces unmodelled waveform reconstructions and can remove glitches that occur during signals. [Pankow et al. (2018) 340 (PRD)] Supernova Search Some burst searches are for targeted sources like supernovae. There is not enough supernova waveforms to match filter search but some supernova waveform features are known. The known features from supernova simulations can be incorporated into supernova searches using machine learning. [Astone et al. (2018) 42 (PRD)] enhance the efficiency of cWB using a neural network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that represent the g-mode emission in supernova waveforms. They use cWB to prepare images of the data. They use colours to determine which detectors find the signal. They find their method increases the sensitivity of traditional cWB. [Iess et al. (2020) 341 (Mach. learn.: sci. technol.)] have a different approach that does not involve cWB. They use a trigger generator called WDF to find excess power in the detector. Then they do a neural network classification to decide if the trigger is a signal or noise. They train directly on supernova waveforms. They use both time series and images of data. They obtain high accuracies with both methods and include glitches. [Chan et al. (2019) 342 (PRD)] also train directly on supernova waveforms. They use only the time series waveforms from different explosion mechanisms. [Cavaglia et al.

Improving Data Quality"},{"location":"#glitch_classification","text":"Some glitches occur only in the GW data channel. We can try and eliminate them by classifying them into different types to help identify their origin. Unfortunately, there is a number of identified classes of glitches for which mitigation methods are not yet understood. For these glitch classes, understanding how searches can separate instrumental transients from similar astrophysical signals is the highest priority [Davis et al. (2020) 28 (CQG)] . PCA based Early ML studies for glitch classification used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). (See [Powell et al. (2015) 29 (CQG)] test on simulated data & [Powell et al. (2017) 30 (CQG)] test on real data). A trigger generator finds the glitches. The time series of whitened glitches are stored in a matrix D on which PCA is performed. See more on [Powell (2017) 31 (PhD Thesis); Cuoco (2018) 32 (Workshop)] PCA is an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms a set of correlated variables into another set of linearly uncorrelated variables, called Principal Components (PCs). The matrix D D is factored so that D= U\\Sigma V^T D= U\\Sigma V^T where V=A^TA V=A^TA , \\Sigma \\Sigma contains eigenvalues, and U U is the PCs. PC coefficients are calculated by taking the dot product of the PCs and the whitened glitch. Then GMM clustering is applied to the PC coefficients. These studies were then improved with the use of Neural Networks. CNN (Images feature) [Razzano & Cuoco 2018 33 (CQG)] apply a CNN to simulated glitches. They build images that cover 2 seconds around each glitch from the whitened time series. Simulated six families of signals. Training, validation, and test set with ratio 70:15:15.

We present a classification pipeline that exploits Convolutional Neural Networks to classify glitches starting from their time frequency evolution represented as images.

GW detector noise is non-Stationary and non-Gaussian. Discrete template bank is built to cover the mass-spin parameter space for potential sources.

It produces unmodelled waveform reconstructions and can remove glitches that occur during signals. [Pankow et al. (2018) 340 (PRD)] Supernova Search Some burst searches are for targeted sources like supernovae. There is not enough supernova waveforms to match filter search but some supernova waveform features are known. The known features from supernova simulations can be incorporated into supernova searches using machine learning. [Astone et al. (2018) 42 (PRD)] enhance the efficiency of cWB using a neural network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that represent the g-mode emission in supernova waveforms. They use cWB to prepare images of the data. They use colours to determine which detectors find the signal. They find their method increases the sensitivity of traditional cWB. [Iess et al. (2020) 341 (Mach. learn.: sci. technol.)] have a different approach that does not involve cWB. They use a trigger generator called WDF to find excess power in the detector. Then they do a neural network classification to decide if the trigger is a signal or noise. They train directly on supernova waveforms. They use both time series and images of data. They obtain high accuracies with both methods and include glitches. [Chan et al. (2019) 342 (PRD)] also train directly on supernova waveforms. They use only the time series waveforms from different explosion mechanisms. [Cavaglia et al.
