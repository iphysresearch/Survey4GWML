  abstract = {The recent application of neural network algorithms to problems in gravitational-wave physics invites the study of how best to build production-ready applications on top of them. By viewing neural networks not as standalone models, but as components or functions in larger data processing pipelines, we can apply lessons learned from both traditional software development practices as well as successful deep learning applications from the private sector. This paper highlights challenges presented by straightforward but na\"ive deployment strategies for deep learning models, and identifies solutions to them gleaned from these sources. It then presents HERMES, a library of tools for implementing these solutions, and describes how HERMES is being used to develop a particular deep learning application which will be deployed during the next data collection run of the International Gravitational-Wave Observatories.},

  abstract = {Interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO, GEO600 and Virgo record a surplus of information above and beyond possible gravitational-wave events. These auxiliary channels capture information about the state of the detector and its surroundings which can be used to infer potential terrestrial noise sources of some gravitational-wave-like events. We present an algorithm addressing the ordering (or equivalently optimizing) of such information from auxiliary systems in gravitational-wave detectors to establish veto conditions in searches for gravitational-wave transients. The procedure was used to identify vetoes for searches for unmodeled transients by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations during their science runs from 2005 through 2007. In this work we present the details of the algorithm; we also use a limited amount of data from LIGO's past runs in order to examine the method, compare it with other methods, and identify its potential to characterize the instruments themselves. We examine the dependence of receiver operating characteristic curves on the various parameters of the veto method and the implementation on real data. We find that the method robustly determines important auxiliary channels, ordering them by the apparent strength of their correlations to the gravitational-wave channel. This list can substantially reduce the background of noise events in the gravitational-wave data. In this way it can identify the source of glitches in the detector as well as assist in establishing confidence in the detection of gravitational-wave transients.},

These algorithms, which do not need any a priori information about the signals, have been originally developed and fully tested in the context of image processing. To illustrate the capabilities of our methods we apply them to two different types of numerically-simulated gravitational wave signals, namely bursts produced from the core collapse of rotating stars and waveforms from binary black hole mergers. We explore the parameter space of the methods to find the set of values best suited for denoising gravitational wave signals under different conditions such as waveform type and signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that noise from gravitational wave signals can be successfully removed with our techniques, irrespective of the signal morphology or astrophysical origin. We also combine our methods with spectrograms and show how those can be used simultaneously with other common techniques in gravitational wave data analysis to improve the chances of detection.},

  abstract = {The recent Nobel-prize-winning detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the subsequent detection of the collision of two neutron stars in coincidence with electromagnetic observations have inaugurated a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. To enhance the scope of this emergent science, we proposed the use of deep convolutional neural networks for the detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals in real-time. This method, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from the first observing run of LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers with continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We show for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of a real GW event observed by LIGO. Our comparisons show that Deep Filtering is far more computationally efficient than matched-filtering, while retaining similar sensitivity and lower errors, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise, with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This approach is uniquely suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time.},

  abstract = {We describe a multivariate classifier for candidate events in a templated search for gravitational-wave (GW) inspiral signals from neutron-star--black-hole (NS-BH) binaries, in data from ground-based detectors where sensitivity is limited by non-Gaussian noise transients. The standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and chi-squared test for inspiral searches use only properties of a single matched filter at the time of an event; instead, we propose a classifier using features derived from a bank of inspiral templates around the time of each event, and also from a search using approximate sine-Gaussian templates. The classifier thus extracts additional information from strain data to discriminate inspiral signals from noise transients. We evaluate a Random Forest classifier on a set of single-detector events obtained from realistic simulated advanced LIGO data, using simulated NS-BH signals added to the data. The new classifier detects a factor of 1.5 -- 2 more signals at low false positive rates as compared to the standard 're-weighted SNR' statistic, and does not require the chi-squared test to be computed. Conversely, if only the SNR and chi-squared values of single-detector events are available, Random Forest classification performs nearly identically to the re-weighted SNR.},

We train a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) on data constructed with spin configurations sampled from the Ising Hamiltonian at different values of temperature and external magnetic field using Monte Carlo methods. From the trained machine we obtain the flow of iterative reconstruction of spin state configurations to faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. We find that the flow of the trained RBM approaches the spin configurations of the maximal possible specific heat which resemble the near criticality region of the Ising model. In the special case of the vanishing magnetic field the trained RBM converges to the critical point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the lattice model. Our results suggest an alternative explanation of how the machine identifies the physical phase transitions, by recognizing certain properties of the configuration like the maximization of the specific heat, instead of associating directly the recognition procedure with the RG flow and its fixed points. Then from the reconstructed data we deduce the critical exponent associated to the magnetization to find satisfactory agreement with the actual physical value. We assume no prior knowledge about the criticality of the system and its Hamiltonian.},

The standard method for the detection of well modeled transient gravitational-wave signals is matched filtering. However, the computational cost of such searches in low latency will grow dramatically as the low frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors improves. Convolutional neural networks provide a highly computationally efficient method for signal identification in which the majority of calculations are performed prior to data taking during a training process. We use only whitened time series of measured gravitational-wave strain as an input, and we train and test on simulated binary black hole signals in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. We show that our network can classify signal from noise with a performance that emulates that of match filtering applied to the same datasets when considering the sensitivity defined by Reciever-Operator characteristics.},

To further enhance the science reach of this emergent field, there is a pressing need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that have enabled these groundbreaking discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we introduce Deep Filtering, a new highly scalable method for end-to-end time-series signal processing, based on a system of two deep convolutional neural networks, which we designed for classification and regression to rapidly detect and estimate parameters of signals in highly noisy time-series data streams. We demonstrate a novel training scheme with gradually increasing noise levels, and a transfer learning procedure between the two networks. We showcase the application of this method for the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Our results indicate that Deep Filtering significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster thus allowing real-time processing of raw big data with minimal resources. More importantly, Deep Filtering extends the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This framework leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and emerging hardware architectures, such as deep-learning-optimized GPUs, to facilitate real-time searches of gravitational wave sources and their electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts.},

Currently, the solution for a given initialization can only be found by performing laborious iterative calculations that have unpredictable and potentially infinite computational cost, due to the system's chaotic nature. We show that an ensemble of converged solutions for the planar chaotic three-body problem obtained using an arbitrarily precise numerical integrator can be used to train a deep artificial neural network (ANN) that, over a bounded time interval, provides accurate solutions at a fixed computational cost and up to 100 million times faster than the numerical integrator. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of training an ANN using converged solutions from an arbitrary precise integrator, relative to solutions computed by a conventional fixed precision integrator, which can introduce errors in the training data, due to numerical round-off and time discretization, that are learned by the ANN. Our results provide evidence that, for computationally challenging regions of phase space, a trained ANN can replace existing numerical solvers, enabling fast and scalable simulations of many-body systems to shed light on outstanding phenomena such as the formation of black hole binary systems or the origin of the core collapse in dense star clusters.},

However, to date, these methods have not yet been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work, we critically examine the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to search for merging black holes. We identify the strengths and limitations of this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating between machine learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the interdisciplinary challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks alone can not be used to claim a statistically significant gravitational-wave detection. However, we demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly flag the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed follow-up. Our convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications scheme. A detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates the potential of such systems as trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note of caution by constructing adversarial examples, which showcase interesting "failure modes" of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the first study that compares different models of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to predict the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters directly from the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization maps. We focus our analysis on four different methods to sample the weights of the network during training: Dropout, DropConnect, Reparameterization Trick (RT), and Flipout. We find out that Flipout outperforms all other methods regardless of the architecture used, and provides tighter constraints for the cosmological parameters. Moreover we compare with MCMC posterior analysis obtaining comparable error correlation among parameters, with BNNs being orders of magnitude faster in inference, although less accurate. Thanks to the speed of the inference process with BNNs, the posterior distribution, outcome of the neural network, can be used as the initial proposal for the Markov Chain. We show that this combined approach increases the acceptance rate in the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and accelerates the convergence of the MCMC, while reaching the same final accuracy. In the second part of the paper, we present a guide to the training and calibration of a successful multi-channel BNN for the CMB temperature and polarization map. We show how tuning the regularization parameter for the standard deviation of the approximate posterior on the weights in Flipout and RT we can produce unbiased and reliable uncertainty estimates, i.e., the regularizer acts like a hyperparameter analogous to the dropout rate in Dropout. Finally, we show how polarization, when combined with the temperature in a unique multi-channel tensor fed to a single BNN, helps to break degeneracies among parameters and provides stringent constraints.},

Traditionally, the computing infrastructure to support these facility's requirements were organized into separate infrastructure that supported their high-throughput needs and those that supported their high-performance computing needs. We argue that to enable and accelerate scientific discovery at the scale and sophistication that is now needed, this separation between high-performance computing and high-throughput computing must be bridged and an integrated, unified infrastructure provided. In this paper, we discuss several case studies where such infrastructure has been implemented. These case studies span different science domains, software systems, and application requirements as well as levels of sustainability. A further aim of this paper is to provide a basis to determine the common characteristics and requirements of such infrastructure, as well as to begin a discussion of how best to support the computing requirements of existing and future experimental science facilities.},

  abstract = {Random projection (RP) is a powerful dimension reduction technique widely used in the analysis of high dimensional data. We demonstrate how this technique can be used to improve the computational efficiency of gravitational wave searches from compact binaries of neutron stars or black holes. Improvements in low-frequency response and bandwidth due to detector hardware upgrades pose a data analysis challenge in the advanced LIGO era as they result in increased redundancy in template databases and longer templates due to the higher number of signal cycles in-band. The RP-based methods presented here address both these issues within the same broad framework. We first use RP for an efficient, singular value decomposition inspired template matrix factorization and develop a geometric intuition for why this approach works. We then use RP to calculate approximate time-domain match correlations in a lower dimensional vector space. For searches over parameters corresponding to non-spinning binaries with a neutron star and a black hole, a combination of the two methods can reduce the total on-line computational cost by an order of magnitude over a nominal baseline. This can, in turn, help free-up computational resources needed to go beyond current spin-aligned searches to more complex ones involving generically spinning waveforms.},

To promote the detection performance and efficiency, we proposed a scheme based on wavelet packet (WP) decomposition and CNN. The WP decomposition is a time-frequency method and can enhance the discriminant features between gravitational wave signal and noise before detection. The CNN conducts the gravitational wave detection by learning a function mapping relation from the data under being processed to the space of detection results. This function-mapping-relation style detection scheme can detection efficiency significantly. In this work, instrument effects are considered, and the noise are computed from a power spectral density (PSD) equivalent to the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. The quantitative evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-art method matched filtering show the excellent performances for BNS gravitational wave detection. On efficiency, the current experiments show that this WP-CNN-based scheme is more than 960 times faster than the matched filtering.},

The objective of this study is to compare the detection efficiency that MLAs can achieve with the efficiency of conventional detection algorithms discussed in an earlier paper.

The ringdown waveform, however, fades out in a very short time with a few cycles, and hence it is challenging for gravitational wave data analysis to extract the ringdown frequency and its damping time scale. We here propose to build up a suite of mock data of gravitational waves to compare the performance of various approaches developed to detect quasi-normal modes from a black hole. In this paper we present our initial results of comparisons of the following five methods; (1) plain matched filtering with ringdown part (MF-R) method, (2) matched filtering with both merger and ringdown parts (MF-MR) method, (3) Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) method, (4) autoregressive modeling (AR) method, and (5) neural network (NN) method.

  abstract = {As the observations of gravitational waves from coalescence of compact objects are expected to be more frequent in the near future, the need for an accurate and fast gravitational waves data analysis framework is becoming more and more relevant. Any analysis requires a waveform model capable of predicting the shape of the gravitational wave signal, given the physical parameters of the source. Currently, several models exist, but they are cursed by the fact that they are slow to compute, hence they are the bottleneck of the task of extracting physical information from the raw data. In our work, we apply Machine Learning methods to build a model designed to generate a gravitational waveform in the time domain as produced by a binary black hole coalescence. Our model matches in accuracy the performance of the state-of-the-art direct computations while, at the same time, it provides a speed up of a a factor of {$\sim$} 30 in the generation of the waveform. Furthermore, our model provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters. This open the possibility to further improve the sampling algorithms used for the parameter estimation. We train our model on a number of waveforms computed by the SEOBNRv2 generator and we infer a relation between the waveform and the masses m1,m2 and spins s1, s2 of the two BHs. In this work, we consider only the case in which the two spins are aligned to the orbital angular momentum. We reduce the dimensionality of our problem by decomposing each waveform in amplitude and phase and it is further represented in a lower dimensional space using a Principal Component Analysis. The regression from orbital parameters to principal components is performed using a Mixture of Expert model. Our implementation is publicly available as a Python package mlgw as https: //pypi.org/project/mlgw/. mlgw has all the features required for performing a full parameter estimation (including the waveform dependence on geometrical parameters). We demonstrate the faithfulness of mlgw by successfully reproducing the inference on GW150914 made by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration.},

  abstract = {During oscillations of cosmology inflation around the minimum of a cuspy potential after inflation, the existence of extra high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) ({$\sim$}GHz) has been proven effectively recently. Based on the electromagnetic resonance system for detecting such extra HFGWs, we adopt a new data processing scheme to identify the corresponding GW signal, which is the transverse perturbative photon fluxes (PPF). In order to overcome the problems of low efficiency and high interference in traditional data processing methods, we adopt deep learning to extract PPF and make some source parameters estimation. Deep learning is able to provide an effective method to realize classification and prediction tasks. Meanwhile, we also adopt anti-overfitting technique and make adjustment of some hyperparameters in the course of study, which improve the performance of classifier and predictor to a certain extent. Here the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to implement deep learning process concretely. In this case, we investigate the classification accuracy varying with the ratio between the number of positive and negative samples. When such ratio exceeds to 0.11, the accuracy could reach up to 100\%. Besides, we also investigate the classification accuracy with different amplitude of extra HFGWs. As a predictor, the mean relative error of parameters estimation decreases when the amplitude of extra HFGWs increases. Especially, when amplitude h(t) is in 10-31\textendash 10-30 the mean relative error reaches around 0.014. On the contrary, the mean relative error increases with frequency increasing in 108\textendash 1011 Hz. At the optimal resonance frequency 5~\texttimes ~109 Hz, the mean relative error is 0.12. Then we also study the mean relative error varying with waist radius W0 of Gaussian beam, its optimal value is 0.138 when W0 is in (0.05 m, 0.1 m) approximately. Compared with classifiers and predictors using other machine learning algorithms, deep CNN for our datasets has higher accuracy and lower error.},

It is often the case that these waveforms are only used to study the properties of black holes. This article tries to extrapolate such methodologies to weaker celestial bodies for the primary purpose of adding a new dimensionality in the prudent realm of possibilities.

Several techniques have been developed to limit the effect of these lines by penalising signals that appear in only a single detector. We have developed a general method, using a convolutional neural network, to reduce the impact of instrumental artefacts on searches that use the SOAP algorithm. The method can identify features in corresponding frequency bands of each detector and classify these bands as containing a signal, an instrumental line, or noise. We tested the method against four different data-sets: Gaussian noise with time gaps, data from the final run of Initial LIGO (S6) with signals added, the reference S6 mock data challenge data set and signals injected into data from the second advanced LIGO observing run (O2). Using the S6 mock data challenge data set and at a 1\% false alarm probability we showed that at 95\% efficiency a fully-automated SOAP search has a sensitivity corresponding to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio of 110, equivalent to a sensitivity depth of 10 Hz{$^($}-1/2), making this automated search competitive with other searches requiring significantly more computing resources and human intervention.},

Moreover, after the detection by LIGO/Virgo collaboration, in 2017, of the first gravitational wave signal emitted during the collision of a binary neutron star system, that was accompanied by the detection of other types of signals coming from the same event, multi-messenger astronomy has claimed its rights more assertively. In this context, it is of great importance in a gravitational wave experiment to have a rapid mechanism of alerting about potential gravitational waves events other observatories capable to detect other types of signals (e.g. in other wavelengths) that are produce by the same event. In this paper, we present the first progress in the development of a neural network algorithm trained to recognize and characterize gravitational wave patterns from signal plus noise data samples. We have implemented two versions of the algorithm, one that classifies the gravitational wave signals into 2 classes, and another one that classifies them into 4 classes, according to the mass ratio of the emitting source. We have obtained promising results, with 100\% training and testing accuracy for the 2-class network and approximately 95\% for the 4-class network. We conclude that the current version of the neural network algorithm demonstrates the ability of a well-configured and calibrated Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory software to classify with very high accuracy and in an extremely short time gravitational wave signals, even when they are accompanied by noise. Moreover, the performance obtained with this algorithm qualifies it as a fast method of data analysis and can be used as a low-latency pipeline for gravitational wave observatories like the future LISA Mission.},

Although the capture of gravitational waves (GWs) by PTAs has not been reported yet, many related theoretical studies and some meaningful detection limits have been reported. In this study, we focused on the nanohertz GWs from individual supermassive binary black holes. Given specific pulsars (PSR J1909-3744, PSR J1713+0747, PSR J0437-4715), the corresponding GW-induced timing residuals in PTAs with Gaussian white noise can be simulated. Further, we report the classification of the simulated PTA data and parameter estimation for potential GW sources using machine learning based on neural networks. As a classifier, the convolutional neural network shows high accuracy when the combined signal to noise ratio {$\geq$}1.33 for our simulated data. Further, we applied a recurrent neural network to estimate the chirp mass ({$\mathscr{M}$}) of the source and luminosity distance (Dp) of the pulsars and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to obtain the uncertainties of chirp mass estimation. Knowledge of the uncertainties is crucial to astrophysical observation. In our case, the mean relative error of chirp mass estimation is less than 13.6\%. Although these results are achieved for simulated PTA data, we believe that they will be important for realizing intelligent processing in PTA data analysis.},

In order to efficiently detect and analyze them, advanced and automatic signal processing and machine learning techniques could help to support standard tools and techniques. Another challenge relates to the large volume of data collected by the detectors on a daily basis, which creates a gap between the amount of data generated and effectively analyzed. In this paper, we propose two approaches involving deep auto-encoder models to analyze time series collected from Gravitational Waves detectors and provide a classification label (noise or real signal). The purpose is to discard noisy time series accurately and identify time series that potentially contain a real phenomenon. Experiments carried out on three datasets show that the proposed approaches implemented using the Apache Spark framework, represent a valuable machine learning tool for astrophysical analysis, offering competitive accuracy and scalability performances with respect to state-of-the-art methods.},

Such analysis is computationally very expensive and necessitates a large-scale exploration of the likelihood surface over the full parameter space. Neural networks have been gaining popularity as tools for gravitational waves analysis for the last few years. They lead to fast gravitational wave detection and parameter inference and hence complement classical slower techniques. This work explores simulation based inference which relies on likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation for the parameters of binary black holes mergers. We build a neural network modeling this ratio and use it in place of the simulator allowing to perform parameter inference in few minutes.

  abstract = {The first direct detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars started the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. Since then, observing merging compact objects has become routine. Other exciting sources still remain undetected. Rapidly-rotating neutron stars are predicted to emit weak, long-lasting quasi-monochromatic waves called continuous gravitational waves (CWs). In the current detector generation, advanced LIGO and Virgo, various noise sources create far more signal output than a potential CW signal. CW data analysis tries to overcome the weakness of the signals by integrating over long stretches of data. Analyzing large amounts of data usually corresponds to large computing cost. For that reason, CW searches for signals from unknown neutron stars are limited in their sensitivity by computational cost. This thesis is concerned with estimating and improving the sensitivity of continuous gravita- tional wave searches. The first main research work presented in this thesis is a new sensitivity estimator that can swiftly and accurately predict the sensitivity of a CW search before it is started. This makes optimizing the search algorithms and therefore improving the sensitivity easier. The accuracy of the estimator is studied by applying it to many different CW searches. The work is expanded with an extensive sensitivity review of past CW searches by calculating their sensitivity depth. The second main part of this thesis is the development of a new CW search method based on deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs are extremely fast once trained and therefore might present an interesting possibility of circumventing the computational limitations and creating a more sensitive CW search. In this thesis such a DNN CW search is developed first as a single-detector search for signals from all over the sky and then expanded to a multi-detector all-sky search and to directed multi-detector searches for signals from a single position in the sky. The DNNs' performance is compared to coherent matched-filtering searches in terms of detection probability at fixed false-alarm level first on idealized Gaussian noise and then on realistic LIGO detector noise. This thesis finds that the DNNs show a lot of potential: For short timespans of about one day the networks only lose a few percent in sensitivity depth compared to coherent matched- filtering. For longer timespans the networks' performance gradually deteriorates making further research necessary. As an outlook to future research, this thesis proposes the combination of short-timespan network outputs, similar to semi-coherent matched-filtering, as a DNN search method over longer timespans.},

However, they also witness non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise that can be mistaken for astrophysical sources, lower detection confidence, or simply complicate the extraction of signal parameters from noisy data. To address this, we present iDQ, a supervised learning framework to autonomously detect noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors based only on auxiliary degrees of freedom insensitive to gravitational waves. iDQ has operated in low latency throughout the advanced detector era at each of the two LIGO interferometers, providing invaluable data quality information about each detection to date in real-time. We document the algorithm, describing the statistical framework and possible applications within gravitational-wave searches. In particular, we construct a likelihood-ratio test that simultaneously accounts for the presence of non-Gaussian noise artifacts and utilizes information from both the observed gravitational-wave strain signal and thousands of auxiliary degrees of freedom. We also present several examples of iDQ's performance with modern interferometers, showing iDQ's ability to autonomously reproduce known data quality monitors and identify noise artifacts not flagged by other analyses.},

Every week, new applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence are added to a growing corpus of work. Random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are now having a genuine impact for applications as diverse as discovering extrasolar planets, transient objects, quasars, and gravitationally lensed systems, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. This review surveys contemporary, published literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence in astronomy and astrophysics. Applications span seven main categories of activity: classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. These categories form the basis of a hierarchy of maturity, as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence emerges, progresses, or becomes established.

Mapping the potential would allow us to determine the spatial distribution of matter - both baryonic and dark - throughout the Galaxy. We present a novel method for determining the gravitational field from a snapshot of the phase-space positions of stars, based only on minimal physical assumptions. We first train a normalizing flow on a sample of observed phase-space positions, obtaining a smooth, differentiable approximation of the phase-space distribution function. Using the collisionless Boltzmann equation, we then find the gravitational potential - represented by a feed-forward neural network - that renders this distribution function stationary. This method is far more flexible than previous parametric methods, which fit narrow classes of analytic models to the data. This is a promising approach to uncovering the density structure of the Milky Way, using rich datasets of stellar kinematics that will soon become available.},

This is the first ML-based search that not only recovers all the binary black hole mergers in the first GW transients calalog (GWTC-1), but also makes a clean detection of GW151216, which was not significant enough to be included in the catalogue. Moreover, we achieve this by only adding a new coincident ranking statistic (MLStat) to a standard analysis that was used for GWTC-1. In CBC searches, reducing contamination by terrestrial and instrumental transients, which create a loud noise background by triggering numerous false alarms, is crucial to improving the sensitivity for detecting true events. The sheer volume of data and and large number of expected detections also prompts the use of ML techniques. We perform transfer learning to train "InceptionV3", a pre-trained deep neural network, along with curriculum learning to distinguish GW signals from noisy events by analysing their continuous wavelet transform (CWT) maps. MLStat incorporates information from this ML classifier into the standard coincident search likelihood used by the conventional search. This leads to at least an order of magnitude improvement in the inverse false-alarm-rate (IFAR) for the previously "low significance" events GW151012, GW170729 and GW151216. The confidence in detection of GW151216 is further strengthened by performing its parameter estimation using . Considering the impressive ability of the statistic to distinguish signals from glitches, the list of marginal events from MLStat could be quite reliable for astrophysical population studies and further follow-up. This work demonstrates the immense potential and readiness of MLStat for finding new sources in current data and possibility of its adaptation in similar searches.},

We compare the classification efficiency between the two ML methods and a conventional low-latency search method with respect to the true positive rate at given false positive rate.

  abstract = {This work investigates the problem of detecting gravitational wave (GW) events based on simulated damped sinusoid signals contaminated with white Gaussian noise. It is treated as a classification problem with one class for the interesting events. The proposed scheme consists of the following two successive steps: decomposing the data using a wavelet packet, representing the GW signal and noise using the derived decomposition coeficients; and determining the existence of any GW event using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a logistic regression output layer. The characteristic of this work is its comprehensive investigations on CNN structure, detection window width, data resolution, wavelet packet decomposition and detection window overlap scheme. Extensive simulation experiments show excellent performances for reliable detection of signals with a range of GW model parameters and signal-to-noise ratios. While we use a simple waveform model in this study, we expect the method to be particularly valuable when the potential GW shapes are too complex to be characterized with a template bank.},

Here, we build a deep learning framework to learn this non-linear relationship, and develop techniques to physically interpret the learnt mapping. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict the mass of dark matter halos from the initial conditions. We find no change in the predictive accuracy of the model if we retrain the model removing anisotropic information from the inputs. This suggests that the features learnt by the CNN are equivalent to spherical averages over the initial conditions. Our results indicate that interpretable deep learning frameworks can provide a powerful tool for extracting insight into cosmological structure formation.},

These GWs have all been emitted by compact binary coalescence, for which we have excellent predictive models. However, there might be other sources for which we do not have reliable models. Some are expected to exist but to be very rare (e.g. supernovae), while others may be totally unanticipated. So far, no unmodelled sources have been discovered, but the lack of models makes the search for such sources much more difficult and less sensitive. We present here a search for unmodelled GW signals using semisupervised machine learning. We apply deep learning and outlier detection algorithms to labelled spectrograms of GW strain data, and then search for spectrograms with anomalous patterns in public LIGO data. We searched \$\{\textbackslash sim\}13\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ of the coincident data from the first two observing runs. No candidates of GW signals were detected in the data analyzed. We evaluate the sensitivity of the search using simulated signals, we show that this search can detect spectrograms containing unusual or unexpected GW patterns, and we report the waveforms and amplitudes for which a \$50\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ detection rate is achieved.},

  abstract = {Detection of gravitational waves (GW) from compact binary mergers provides a new window into multi-messenger astrophysics. The standard technique to determine the merger parameters is matched filtering, consisting in comparing the signal to a template bank. This approach can be time consuming and computationally expensive due to the large amount of experimental data which needs to be analyzed. In the attempt to find more efficient data analysis methods we develop a new frequency domain convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict the merger masses from the spectrogram of the detector signal, and compare it to time domain neural networks (TCNN). Since FCNNs are trained using spectrograms, the dimension of the input is reduced as compared to TCNNs, implying a substantially lower number of model parameters, and consequently less over-fitting. The additional time required to compute the spectrogram is approximately compensated by the lower execution time of the FCNNs, due to the lower number of parameters. In our analysis FCNNs show a slightly better performance on validation data and a substantially lower over-fit, as expected due to the lower number of parameters, providing a new promising approach to the analysis of GW detectors data, which could be further improved in the future by using more efficient and faster computations of the spectrogram.},

Understanding which features in the data determine the output of these nested, non-linear algorithms is an important but challenging task. We analyze a DNN that has been found in previous work to accurately recover cosmological parameters in simulated maps of the WL convergence ({$\kappa$}). We derive constraints on the cosmological parameter pair ({$\Omega_m$},{$\sigma_8$}) from a combination of three commonly used WL statistics (power spectrum, lensing peaks, and Minkowski functionals), using ray-traced simulated {$\kappa$} maps. We show that the network can improve the inferred parameter constraints relative to this combination by 20\% even in the presence of realistic levels of shape noise. We apply a series of well established saliency methods to interpret the DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme {$\kappa$} values. For noiseless maps, regions with negative {$\kappa$} account for 86-69\% of the attribution of the DNN output, defined as the square of the saliency in input space. In the presence of shape nose, the attribution concentrates in high convergence regions, with 36-68\% of the attribution in regions with {$\kappa$} \textquestiondown{} 3 {$\sigma_{(}\kappa$}).},

A hidden Markov model (HMM), combined with a maximum-likelihood matched filter, tracks rapid frequency evolution semi-coherently in a computationally efficient manner. We present the results of an HMM search targeting 12 young supernova remnants in data from Advanced LIGO's second observing run. Six targets produce candidates that are above the search threshold and survive pre-defined data quality vetoes. However, follow-up analyses of these candidates show that they are all consistent with instrumental noise artefacts.},

  abstract = {All-sky observations of the Milky Way show both Galactic and non-Galactic diffuse emission, for example from interstellar matter or the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The different emitters are partly superimposed in the measurements, partly they obscure each other, and sometimes they dominate within a certain spectral range. The decomposition of the underlying radiative components from spectral data is a signal reconstruction problem and often associated with detailed physical modeling and substantial computational effort. We aim to build an effective and self-instructing algorithm detecting the essential spectral information contained Galactic all-sky data covering spectral bands from {$\gamma$}-ray to radio waves. Utilizing principles from information theory, we develop a state-of-the-art variational autoencoder specialized on the adaption to Gaussian noise statistics. We first derive a generic generative process that leads from a low-dimensional set of emission features to the observed high-dimensional data. We formulate a posterior distribution of these features using Bayesian methods and approximate this posterior with variational inference. The algorithm efficiently encodes the information of 35 Galactic emission data sets in ten latent feature maps. These contain the essential information required to reconstruct the initial data with high fidelity and are ranked by the algorithm according to their significance for data regeneration. The three most significant feature maps encode astrophysical components: (1) The dense interstellar medium (ISM), (2) the hot and dilute regions of the ISM and (3) the CMB. The machine-assisted and data-driven dimensionality reduction of spectral data is able to uncover the physical features encoding the input data. Our algorithm is able to extract the dense and dilute Galactic regions, as well as the CMB, from the sky brightness values only.},

There is a need for the development of fast and efficient algorithms to detect non-astrophysical transients and noises due to the rate and scale at which the data is being provided by LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories. These transients and noises can interfere with the study of gravitational waves and binary mergers and induce false positives. Here, we propose the use of deep learning algorithms to detect and classify these transient signals. Traditional statistical methods are not well designed for dealing with temporal signals but supervised deep learning techniques such as RNN-LSTM and deep CNN have proven to be effective for solving problems such as time-series forecasting and time-series classification. We also use unsupervised models such as Total variation, Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Wavelet decomposition or Random Forests for feature extraction and noise reduction and then study the results obtained by RNN-LSTM and deep CNN for classifying the transients in low-SNR signals. We compare the results obtained by the combination of various unsupervised models and supervised models. This method can be extended to real-time detection of transients and merger signals using deep-learning optimized GPU's for early prediction and study of various astronomical events. We will also explore and compare other machine learning models such as MLP, Stacked Autoencoder, Random forests, extreme learning machine, Support Vector machine and logistic regression classifier.},

Matched-filtering based algorithms have traditionally been used to extract quiet signals embedded in noise. We introduce a novel neural-network based machine learning algorithm that uses time series strain data from gravitational-wave detectors to detect signals from non-spinning binary neutron star mergers. For the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, our network has an average sensitive distance of 130 Mpc at a false-alarm rate of 10 per month. Compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we find an improvement by a factor of 6 in sensitivity to signals with signal-to-noise ratio below 25. However, this approach is not yet competitive with traditional matched-filtering based methods. A conservative estimate indicates that our algorithm introduces on average 10.2 s of latency between signal arrival and generating an alert. We give an exact description of our testing procedure, which can not only be applied to machine learning based algorithms but all other search algorithms as well. We thereby improve the ability to compare machine learning and classical searches.},

Various regression and interpolation techniques have been employed to build efficient waveform models, but no study has systematically compared the performance of these methods yet. Here we provide such a comparison. For analytical binary-black-hole waveforms, assuming either aligned or precessing spins, we compare the accuracy as well as the computational speed of a variety of regression methods, ranging from traditional interpolation to machine-learning techniques. We find that most methods are reasonably accurate, but efficiency considerations favour in many cases the simpler approaches. We conclude that sophisticated regression methods are not necessarily needed in standard gravitational-wave modeling applications, although machine-learning techniques might be more suitable for problems with higher complexity than what is tested here.},

This article introduces VAMANA, which reconstructs the binary black hole population using a mixture model and facilitates excellent density measurement as informed by the data. VAMANA uses a mixture of weighted Gaussians to reconstruct the chirp mass distribution. We expect Gaussian mixtures to provide flexibility in modeling complex distributions and enable us in capturing details in the astrophysical chirp mass distribution. Each of the Gaussian in the mixture is combined with another Gaussian and a power-law to simultaneously model the spin component aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the mass ratio distribution, thus also wing us to capture their variation with the chirp mass. Additionally, we can also introduce broadband smoothing by restricting the Gaussian mixture to lie within a threshold distance of a predefined reference chirp mass distribution. Using simulated data we show the robustness of our method in reconstructing complex populations for a large number of observations. We also apply our method to the publicly available catalog of GW observations made during LIGO's and Virgo's first and second observation runs and present the reconstructed mass, spin distribution, and the estimated merger rate of binary black holes.},

Such substructure is hard to model and is either ignored by traditional, smooth modelling, approaches, or treated as well-localized massive perturbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to quantify the statistical properties of such perturbations directly from images, where only the extended lensed source features within a mask are considered, without the need of any lens modelling. Our training data consist of mock lensed images assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens potential, and, for the first time, using images of real galaxies as the lensed source. We employ a novel deep neural network that can handle arbitrary uncertainty intervals associated with the training data set labels as input, provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss function. The method succeeds not only in accurately estimating the actual parameter values, but also reduces the predicted confidence intervals by 10~per\,cent in an unsupervised manner, i.e. without having access to the actual ground truth values. Our results are invariant to the inherent degeneracy between mass perturbations in the lens and complex brightness profiles for the source. Hence, we can quantitatively and robustly quantify the smoothness of the mass density of thousands of lenses, including confidence intervals, and provide a consistent ranking for follow-up science.},

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences constrain the neutron-star equation of state by enabling measurement of the tidal deformation of each neutron star. This deformation is well approximated by the tidal deformability parameter {$\Lambda$}, which was constrained using the first binary neutron star gravitational-wave observation, GW170817. Now, with the measurement of the second binary neutron star, GW190425, we can combine different gravitational-wave measurements to obtain tighter constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. In this paper, we combine data from GW170817 and GW190425 to place constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. To facilitate this calculation, we derive interpolated marginalized likelihoods for each event using a machine learning algorithm. These likelihoods, which we make publicly available, allow for results from multiple gravitational-wave signals to be easily combined. Using these new data products, we find that the radius of a fiducial 1.4~M{$\odot$} neutron star is constrained to \$11.6\^\{+1.6\}\_\{-0.9\}\$~km at 90~per~cent confidence and the pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density is constrained to \$3.1\^\{+3.1\}\_\{-1.3\}\textbackslash times 10\^\{34\}\$~dyne\,cm-2 at 90~per~cent confidence. Combining GW170817 and GW190425 produces constraints indistinguishable from GW170817 alone and is consistent with findings from other works.},

Our findings show that deep learning can identify eccentric signals from a few seconds (for binary black holes) up to tens of seconds (for binary neutron stars) prior to merger. A quantized version of our neural networks achieves 4\texttimes{} reduction in model size, and up to 2.5\texttimes{} inference speedup.

We constrain PBH formation models within a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning techniques, finding best-fit values for distinctive features of these models, including the PBH initial mass function, the fraction of PBHs in dark matter, and the accretion efficiency. The presence of several spinning binaries in the GWTC-2 dataset favors a scenario in which PBHs accrete and spin up. Our results indicate that PBHs may comprise only a fraction smaller than 0.3 \% of the total dark matter, and that the predicted PBH abundance is still compatible with other constraints.},

One pressing question is to understand the fraction of binaries originating from different formation channels, such as isolated field formation versus dynamical formation in dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we combine the {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{O}\mathtt{S}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{I}\mathtt{C}$} binary population synthesis suite and the {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{C}$} code for globular cluster evolution to create a mixture model for black hole binary formation under both formation scenarios. For the first time, these code bodies are combined self-consistently, with {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{C}$} itself employing {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{O}\mathtt{S}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{I}\mathtt{C}$} to track stellar evolution. We then use a deep-learning enhanced hierarchical Bayesian analysis to constrain the mixture fraction f between formation models, while simultaneously constraining the common envelope efficiency {$\alpha$} assumed in {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{O}\mathtt{S}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{I}\mathtt{C}$} and the initial cluster virial radius r\textsubscript{v} assumed in {$\mathtt{C}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{C}$}. Under specific assumptions about other uncertain aspects of isolated binary and globular cluster evolution, we report the median and 90\% confidence interval of three physical parameters (f,{$\alpha$},r\textsubscript{v})=(0.20{$^($}+0.32){$_($}-0.18),2.26{$^($}+2.65){$_($}-1.84),2.71{$^($}+0.83){$_($}-1.17)). This simultaneous constraint agrees with observed properties of globular clusters in the Milky Way and is an important first step in the pathway toward learning astrophysics of compact binary formation from GW observations.},

In addition, matched-filtering techniques are based on the template bank of the existing theoretical waveform, which makes it difficult to find GW signals beyond theoretical expectation. In this paper, based on the task of GW detection of binary black holes, we introduce the optimization techniques of deep learning, such as batch normalization and dropout, to CNN models. Detailed studies of model performance are carried out. Through this study, we recommend to use batch normalization and dropout techniques in CNN models in GW signal detection tasks. Furthermore, we investigate the generalization ability of CNN models on different parameter ranges of GW signals. We point out that CNN models are robust to the variation of the parameter range of the GW waveform. This is a major advantage of deep learning models over matched-filtering techniques.},

Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS). It consists of three parts: a pipeline to select host candidates of GW and sort their priorities for follow-up observation, an identification module to find the transient from follow-up observation data, and a visualization module to display GW-related data. GWOPS can rapidly respond to GW events. With GWOPS, the operations such as follow-up observation planning, data storage, data visualization, and transient identification can be efficiently coordinated, which will promote the success searching rate for GWs EM counterparts.},

Several works have attempted to perform fast retrievals of atmospheric parameters with the use of machine-learning algorithms like deep neural networks (DNNs). Yet, despite their high predictive power, DNNs are also infamous for being ``black boxes.'' It is their apparent lack of explainability that makes the astrophysics community reluctant to adopt them. What are their predictions based on? How confident should we be in them? When are they wrong, and how wrong can they be? In this work, we present a number of general evaluation methodologies that can be applied to any trained model and answer questions like these. In particular, we train three different popular DNN architectures to retrieve atmospheric parameters from exoplanet spectra and show that all three achieve good predictive performance. We then present an extensive analysis of the predictions of DNNs, which can inform us\textendash among other things\textendash of the credibility limits for atmospheric parameters for a given instrument and model. Finally, we perform a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis to identify to which features of the spectrum the outcome of the retrieval is most sensitive. We conclude that, for different molecules, the wavelength ranges to which the DNNs predictions are most sensitive do indeed coincide with their characteristic absorption regions. The methodologies presented in this work help to improve the evaluation of DNNs and to grant interpretability to their predictions.},

The GW signal waveforms are injected in public data from the O2 run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors, in time windows that do not coincide with those of known detected signals. We demonstrate that DL algorithms, trained with GW signal waveforms at distances of 2000 Mpc, still show high accuracy when detecting closer signals, within the ranges considered in our analysis. Moreover, by combining the results of the three-detector network in a unique RGB image, the single detector performance is improved by as much as 70\%. Furthermore, we train a regression network to perform parameter inference on BBH spectrogram data and apply this network to the events from the GWTC-1 and GWTC-2 catalogs. Without significant optimization of our algorithms we obtain results that are mostly consistent with published results by the LIGO\textendash Virgo Collaboration. In particular, our predictions for the chirp mass are compatible (up to 3{$\sigma$}) with the official values for 90\% of events.

However, detections of the early inspiral phase by the gravitational wave detectors would allow the observation of the earlier stages of the merger in the electromagnetic band, improving multi-messenger astronomy and giving access to new information. In this paper, we introduce a new machine-learning-based approach to produce early-warning alerts for an inspiraling binary neutron star system, based only on the early inspiral part of the signal. We give a proof of concept to show the possibility to use a combination of small convolutional neural networks trained on the whitened detector strain in the time domain to detect and classify early inspirals. Each of those is targeting a specific range of chirp masses dividing the binary neutron star category into three sub-classes: light, intermediate and heavy. In this work, we focus on one LIGO detector at design sensitivity and generate noise from the design power spectral density. We show that within this setup it is possible to produce an early alert up to 100 seconds before the merger for the best-case scenario. We also present some future upgrades that will enhance the detection capabilities of our convolutional neural networks. Finally, we also show that the current number of detections for a realistic binary neutron star population is comparable to that of matched filtering and that there is a high probability to detect GW170817- and GW190425-like events at design sensitivity.},

In our first paper [1], we implemented a deep learning clustering network capable of correctly identifying clusters due to large signals. In this paper, a network is implemented that can detect clusters due to much fainter signals. These two networks are complementary and we show that a cascade of the two networks achieves an excellent detection efficiency across a wide range of signal strengths, with a false alarm rate comparable/lower than that of methods currently in use.},

  abstract = {Isolated neutron stars are prime targets for continuous-wave (CW) searches by ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers. Results are presented from a CW search targeting ten pulsars. The search uses a semi-coherent algorithm, which combines the maximum-likelihood {$\mathmit{F}$}-statistic with a hidden Markov model (HMM) to efficiently detect and track quasi-monochromatic signals which wander randomly in frequency. The targets, which are associated with TeV sources detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), are chosen to test for gravitational radiation from young, energetic pulsars with strong {$\gamma$}-ray emission, and take maximum advantage of the frequency tracking capabilities of HMM compared to other CW search algorithms. The search uses data from the second observing run of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO). It scans 1-Hz sub-bands around f\textsubscript{*}, 4f\textsubscript{*}/3, and 2f\textsubscript{*}, where f\textsubscript{*} denotes the star's rotation frequency, in order to accommodate a physically plausible frequency mismatch between the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave emission. The 24 sub-bands searched in this study return 5,256 candidates above the Gaussian threshold with a false alarm probability of 1\% per sub-band per target. Only 12 candidates survive the three data quality vetoes which are applied to separate non-Gaussian artifacts from true astrophysical signals. CW searches using the data from subsequent observing runs will clarify the status of the remaining candidates.},

In this study, we benchmark the performance of two emulators that learn the truncated power-law phenomenological model by using Gaussian process regression and normalizing flows techniques to see which one is a more capable likelihood emulator in the population inference. We benchmark the characteristic of the emulators by comparing their performance in the population inference to the phenomenological model using mock and real observation data. Our results suggest that the normalizing flows emulator can recover the posterior distribution by using the phenomenological model in the population inference with up to 300 mock injections. The normalizing flows emulator also underestimates the uncertainty for some posterior distributions in the population inference on real observation data. On the other hand, the Gaussian process regression emulator has poor performance on the same task and can only be used effectively in low-dimension cases.},

We introduce a deep learning architecture to push forward this problem for compact systems. While current machine learning algorithms in this area rely on scientist-derived instability metrics, our new technique learns its own metrics from scratch, enabled by a internal structure inspired from dynamics theory. Our model can quickly and accurately predict instability timescales in compact multiplanet systems, and does so with an accurate uncertainty estimate for unfamiliar systems. This opens up the development of fast terrestrial planet formation models, and enables the efficient exploration of stable regions in parameter space for multiplanet systems.We introduce a Bayesian neural network model that can accurately predict not only if, but also when a compact planetary system with three or more planets will go unstable. Our model, trained directly from short N-body time series of raw orbital elements, is more than two orders of magnitude more accurate at predicting instability times than analytical estimators, while also reducing the bias of existing machine learning algorithms by nearly a factor of three. Despite being trained on compact resonant and near-resonant three-planet configurations, the model demonstrates robust generalization to both nonresonant and higher multiplicity configurations, in the latter case outperforming models fit to that specific set of integrations. The model computes instability estimates up to 105 times faster than a numerical integrator, and unlike previous efforts provides confidence intervals on its predictions.

Despite the success of matched filtering, due to its computational cost, there has been recent interest in developing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for signal detection. Designing these networks remains a challenge as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy to set the hyperparameter values. We propose a new method for hyperparameter optimization based on genetic algorithms (GAs). We compare six different GA variants and explore different choices for the GA-optimized fitness score. We show that the GA can discover high-quality architectures when the initial hyperparameter seed values are far from a good solution as well as refining already good networks. For example, when starting from the architecture proposed by George and Huerta, the network optimized over the 20-dimensional hyperparameter space has 78\% fewer trainable parameters while obtaining an 11\% increase in accuracy for our test problem. Using genetic algorithm optimization to refine an existing network should be especially useful if the problem context (e.g., statistical properties of the noise, signal model, etc) changes and one needs to rebuild a network. In all of our experiments, we find the GA discovers significantly less complicated networks as compared to the seed network, suggesting it can be used to prune wasteful network structures. While we have restricted our attention to CNN classifiers, our GA hyperparameter optimization strategy can be applied within other machine learning settings.},

This involves evaluating a multidimensional posterior probability function with stochastic sampling. The marginal probability distributions of the samples are sometimes interpolated with methods such as kernel density estimators. Since most post-processing analysis within the field is based on these parameter estimation products, interpolation accuracy of the marginals is essential. In this work, we propose a new method combining histograms and Gaussian processes (GPs) as an alternative technique to fit arbitrary combinations of samples from the source parameters. This method comes with several advantages such as flexible interpolation of non-Gaussian correlations, Bayesian estimate of uncertainty, and efficient resampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.},

  abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves is considered to be one of the most magnificent discoveries of the century. Due to the high computational cost of matched filtering pipeline, there is a hunt for an alternative powerful system. I present, for the first time, the use of 1D residual neural network for detection of gravitational waves. Residual networks have transformed many fields like image classification, face recognition and object detection with their robust structure. With increase in sensitivity of LIGO detectors we expect many more sources of gravitational waves in the universe to be detected. However, deep learning networks are trained only once. When used for classification task, deep neural networks are trained to predict only a fixed number of classes. Therefore, when a new type of gravitational wave is to be detected, this turns out to be a drawback of deep learning. Shallow neural networks can be used to learn data with simple patterns but fail to give good results with increase in complexity of data. Remodelling the neural network with detection of each new type of GW is highly infeasible. In this letter, I also discuss ways to reduce the time required to adapt to such changes in detection of gravitational waves for deep learning methods. Primarily, I aim to create a custom residual neural network for 1-dimensional time series inputs, which can learn a ton of features from dataset without giving up on increasing the number of classes or increasing the complexity of data. I use the two class of binary coalescence signals (Binary Black Hole Merger and Binary Neutron Star Merger signals) detected by LIGO to check the performance of residual structure on gravitational waves detection.},

Using Bayesian machine learning analysis, constraints on the free parameters of both models are obtained for the three redshift ranges: z{$\in$} [0,2], z{$\in$} [0,2.5], and z{$\in$} [0,5], respectively. For the first two redshift ranges, high-quality observations of the expansion rate H(z) exist already, and they are used for validating the fitting results. Additionally, the extended range z{$\in$} [0,5] provides predictions of the model parameters, verified when reliable higher-redshift H(z) data are available. This learning procedure, based on the expansion rate data generated from the background dynamics of each model, shows that, at cosmological scales, there is a deviation from the cold dark matter paradigm, {$\omega_($}dm) {$\neq$} 0, for all three redshift ranges. The results show that this approach may qualify as a solution to the H{$_0$} tension problem.

  abstract = {Sensitive gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as that of Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) realize the direct observation of GW signals that confirm Einstein's general theory of relativity. However, it remains challenges to quickly detect faint GW signals from a large number of time series with background noise under unknown probability distributions. Traditional methods such as matched-filtering in general assume Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and are far from being real-time due to its high computational complexity. To avoid these weaknesses, one-dimensional (1D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are introduced to achieve fast online detection in milliseconds but do not have enough consideration on the trade-off between the frequency and time features, which will be revisited in this paper through data pre-processing and subsequent two-dimensional (2D) CNNs during offline training to improve the online detection sensitivity. In this work, the input data is pre-processed to form a 2D spectrum by Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), where frequency features are extracted without learning. Then, carrying out two 1D convolutions across time and frequency axes respectively, and concatenating the time-amplitude and frequency-amplitude feature maps with equal proportion subsequently, the frequency and time features are treated equally as the input of our following two-dimensional CNNs. The simulation of our above ideas works on a generated data set with uniformly varying SNR (2-17), which combines the GW signal generated by PYCBC and the background noise sampled directly from LIGO. Satisfying the real-time online detection requirement without noise distribution assumption, the experiments of this paper demonstrate better performance on average compared to that of 1D CNNs, especially in the cases of lower SNR (4-9).},

For binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole systems prompt counterpart electromagnetic signatures are expected on timescales between 1 s and 1 min. However, the current fastest method for alerting electromagnetic follow-up observers can provide estimates in of the order of 1 min on a limited range of key source parameters. Here, we show that a conditional variational autoencoder pretrained on binary black hole signals can return Bayesian posterior probability estimates. The training procedure need only be performed once for a given prior parameter space and the resulting trained machine can then generate samples describing the posterior distribution around six orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques.},

  abstract = {Multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers offer a promising path towards resolution of the Hubble constant (H{$_0$}) tension, provided their constraints are shown to be free from systematics such as the Malmquist bias. In the traditional Bayesian framework, accounting for selection effects in the likelihood requires calculation of the expected number (or fraction) of detections as a function of the parameters describing the population and cosmology; a potentially costly and/or inaccurate process. This calculation can, however, be bypassed completely by performing the inference in a framework in which the likelihood is never explicitly calculated, but instead fit using forward simulations of the data, which naturally include the selection. This is Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI). Here, we use density-estimation LFI, coupled to neural-network-based data compression, to infer H{$_0$} from mock catalogues of binary neutron star mergers, given noisy redshift, distance and peculiar velocity estimates for each object. We demonstrate that LFI yields statistically unbiased estimates of H{$_0$} in the presence of selection effects, with precision matching that of sampling the full Bayesian hierarchical model. Marginalizing over the bias increases the H{$_0$} uncertainty by only 6\% for training sets consisting of O(10{$^4$}) populations. The resulting LFI framework is applicable to population-level inference problems with selection effects across astrophysics.},

Several techniques exist and, recently, Artificial Neural Networks have been incorporated to this type of analysis. By using Artificial Neural Networks we present a new strategy to perform non-parametric data reconstructions without any preliminary statistical or theoretical assumptions and even for small observational datasets. In particular, we reconstruct cosmological observables from cosmic chronometers, f{$\sigma_8$} measurements and the distance modulus of the Type Ia supernovae. In addition, we introduce a first approach to generate synthetic covariance matrices through a variational autoencoder, for which we employ the covariance matrix of the Type Ia supernovae compilation. To test the usefulness of our developed methods, with the neural network models we generated random data points mostly absent in the original datasets and performed a Bayesian analysis on some simple dark energy models. Some of our findings point out to slight deviations from the {$\Lambda$}CDM standard model, contrary to the expected values coming from the original datasets.},

To mitigate this problem, we propose to use machine learning to rapidly rule out a vast majority of candidate lensed pairs. As a proof of principle, we simulate non-spinning binary black hole events added to Gaussian noise, and train the machine on their time-frequency maps (Q-transforms) and localisation skymaps (using Bayestar), both of which can be generated in seconds.

To infer the system parameters, iterative sampling algorithms such as MCMC are typically used with Bayes' theorem to obtain posterior samples\textemdash by repeatedly generating waveforms and comparing to measured strain data. However, as the rate of detections grows with detector sensitivity, this poses a growing computational challenge. To confront this challenge, as well as that of fast multimessenger alerts, in this study we apply deep learning to learn non-iterative surrogate models for the Bayesian posterior. We train a neural-network conditional density estimator to model posterior probability distributions over the full 15-dimensional space of binary black hole system parameters, given detector strain data from multiple detectors. We use the method of normalizing flows\textemdash specifically, a neural spline flow\textemdash which allows for rapid sampling and density estimation. Training the network is likelihood-free, requiring samples from the data generative process, but no likelihood evaluations. Through training, the network learns a global set of posteriors: it can generate thousands of independent posterior samples per second for any strain data consistent with the training distribution.

A feed forward NN is trained to minimise this loss function evaluated on a set of collocation points sampled from the domain where the problem is defined. A compact and smooth solution, that only depends on the weights of the trained NN, is then obtained. This approach is often referred to as PINN, from Physics Informed Neural Network raissi2017physics{$_1$}, raissi2017physics{$_2$}. Despite the success of the PINN approach in solving various classes of PDEs, an implementation of this idea that is capable of solving a large class of ODEs and PDEs with good accuracy and without the need to finely tune the hyperparameters of the network, is not available yet. In this paper, we introduce a new implementation of this concept - called dNNsolve - that makes use of dual Neural Networks to solve ODEs/PDEs. These include: i) sine and sigmoidal activation functions, that provide a more efficient basis to capture both secular and periodic patterns in the solutions; ii) a newly designed architecture, that makes it easy for the the NN to approximate the solution using the basis functions mentioned above.

Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for reconstructing the fields that distort the primary CMB and produce secondary anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with current data, quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and other effects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable of the simultaneous reconstruction of two sources of secondary CMB anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We show that the ResUNet-CMB network significantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low noise levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy reionization reconstruction that would be present with a straightforward application of the quadratic estimator.},

Thus, we are able to implement the nonparametric FFNN representation of the EoSs. This new representation is validated by its capability of fitting the theoretical EoSs and recovering the injected parameters. Then, we adopt this nonparametric method to analyze the real data, including the mass\textendash tidal deformability measurement from the binary neutron star merger gravitational-wave event GW170817 and mass\textendash radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451 by NICER. We take the publicly available samples to construct the likelihood and use the nested sampling to obtain the posteriors of the parameters of the FFNN according to the Bayesian theorem, which in turn can be translated to the posteriors of the EoS parameters. Combining all of these data for a canonical 1.4 M {$\odot$} neutron star, we get a radius km and tidal deformability (90\% confidence interval). Furthermore, we find that in the high-density region ({$\geq$}3{$\rho$} sat), the 90\% lower limits of (where c s is the sound speed and c is the velocity of light in vacuum) are above 1/3, which means that the so-called conformal limit (i.e., ) is not always valid in the neutron stars.},

Here we develop a workflow that connects the Data and Learning Hub for Science, a repository for publishing AI models, with the Hardware-Accelerated Learning (HAL) cluster, using funcX as a universal distributed computing service. Using this workflow, an ensemble of four openly available AI models can be run on HAL to process an entire month's worth (August 2017) of advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory data in just seven minutes, identifying all four binary black hole mergers previously identified in this dataset and reporting no misclassifications.

  abstract = {We live in momentous times. The science community is empowered with an arsenal of cosmic messengers to study the universe in unprecedented detail. Gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays cover a wide range of wavelengths and timescales. Combining and processing these datasets that vary in volume, speed, and dimensionality requires new modes of instrument coordination, funding, and international collaboration with a specialized human and technological infrastructure. In tandem with the advent of large-scale scientific facilities, the last decade has experienced an unprecedented transformation in computing and signal-processing algorithms. The combination of graphics processing units, deep learning, and the availability of open source, high-quality datasets has powered the rise of artificial intelligence. This digital revolution now powers a multibillion dollar industry, with far-reaching implications in technology and society. In this chapter, we describe pioneering efforts to adapt artificial intelligence algorithms to address computational grand challenges in multi-messenger astrophysics. We review the rapid evolution of these disruptive algorithms, from the first class of algorithms introduced in early 2017 to the sophisticated algorithms that now incorporate domain expertise in their architectural design and optimization schemes. We discuss the importance of scientific visualization and extreme-scale computing in reducing time-to-insight and obtaining new knowledge from the interplay between models and data.},

Here, we expand on the Physical Review Letter that introduced the first fast and accurate fully-relativistic EMRI waveform template model. We discuss the construction of the overall framework; constituent modules; and the general methods used to accelerate EMRI waveforms. Because the fully relativistic FEW model waveforms are for now limited to eccentric orbits in the Schwarzschild spacetime, we also introduce an improved Augmented Analytic Kludge (AAK) model that describes generic Kerr inspirals. Both waveform models can be accelerated using graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware. With the GPU-accelerated waveforms in hand, a variety of studies are performed including an analysis of EMRI mode content, template mismatch, and fully Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based EMRI parameter estimation. We find relativistic EMRI waveform templates can be generated with fewer harmonic modes (\$\textbackslash sim10-100\$) without biasing signal extraction. However, we show for the first time that extraction of a relativistic injection with semi-relativistic amplitudes can lead to strong bias and anomalous structure in the posterior distribution for certain regions of parameter space.},

We show that only a single time series of (possibly noisy) waveform data is necessary to construct the equations of motion for a BBH system. Starting with a class of universal differential equations parameterized by feed-forward neural networks, our strategy involves the construction of a space of plausible mechanical models and a physics-informed constrained optimization within that space to minimize the waveform error. We apply our method to various BBH systems including extreme and comparable mass ratio systems in eccentric and non-eccentric orbits. We show the resulting differential equations apply to time durations longer than the training interval, and relativistic effects, such as perihelion precession, radiation reaction, and orbital plunge, are automatically accounted for. The methods outlined here provide a new, data-driven approach to studying the dynamics of binary black hole systems.},

To extract as much information as possible from GW observations we must develop methods to reduce the cost of Bayesian inference. In this paper, we use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the parallelisation power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the surrogate modelling method, which can produce accelerated versions of existing models. As a first application of our method, ANN-Sur, we build a time-domain surrogate model of the spin-aligned binary black hole (BBH) waveform model SEOBNRv4. We achieve median mismatches of 2e-5 and mismatches no worse than 2e-3. For a typical BBH waveform generated from 12 Hz with a total mass of 60 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} the original SEOBNRv4 model takes 1812 ms. Existing bespoke code optimisations (SEOBNRv4opt) reduced this to 91.6 ms and the interpolation based, frequency-domain surrogate SEOBNRv4ROM can generate this waveform in 6.9 ms. Our ANN-Sur model, when run on a CPU takes 2.7 ms and just 0.4 ms when run on a GPU. ANN-Sur can also generate large batches of waveforms simultaneously. We find that batches of up to 10{$^4$} waveforms can be evaluated on a GPU in just 163 ms, corresponding to a time per waveform of 0.016 ms. This method is a promising way to utilise the parallelisation power of GPUs to drastically increase the computational efficiency of Bayesian parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {Accurate simulation of fluids is important for many science and engineering problems but is very computationally demanding. In contrast, machine-learning models can approximate physics very quickly but at the cost of accuracy. Here we show that using machine learning inside traditional fluid simulations can improve both accuracy and speed, even on examples very different from the training data. Our approach opens the door to applying machine learning to large-scale physical modeling tasks like airplane design and climate prediction.Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10\texttimes{} finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.Source code for our models, including learned components, and training and evaluation datasets are available at GitHub (https://github.com/google/jax-cfd).},

Current Bayesian inference methodologies, although highly accurate and reliable, are slow. Deep learning models have shown themselves to be accurate and extremely fast for inference tasks on gravitational waves, but their output is inherently questionable due to the blackbox nature of neural networks. In this work, we join Bayesian inference and deep learning by applying importance sampling on an approximate posterior generated by a multi-headed convolutional neural network. The neural network parametrizes Von Mises-Fisher and Gaussian distributions for the sky coordinates and two masses for given simulated gravitational wave injections in the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We generate skymaps for unseen gravitational-wave events that highly resemble predictions generated using Bayesian inference in a few minutes. Furthermore, we can detect poor predictions from the neural network, and quickly flag them.},

In particular, the application of these methods to the full signal parameter space available to the gravitational-wave detectors, and/or real-time parameter estimation is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, rapid detection and inference are critical for prompt follow-up of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying important transients, such as binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers. Training deep neural networks to identify specific signals and learn a computationally efficient representation of the mapping between gravitational-wave signals and their parameters allows both detection and inference to be done quickly and reliably, with high sensitivity and accuracy. In this work we apply a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify and characterize transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron-star mergers in real LIGO data. We show for the first time that artificial neural networks can promptly detect and characterize binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals in real LIGO data, and distinguish them from noise and signals from coalescing black-hole binaries. We illustrate this key result by demonstrating that our deep-learning framework classifies correctly all gravitational-wave events from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-1 [Abbott et al. (2019) [4]]. These results emphasize the importance of using realistic gravitational-wave detector data in machine learning approaches, and represent a step towards achieving real-time detection and inference of gravitational waves.},

This is achieved by incorporating the Bayesian approach into the CLDNN classifier, which integrates together the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Our model successfully detect all seven BBH events in the LIGO Livingston O2 data, with the periods of their GW waveforms correctly labeled. The ability of a Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation enables a newly defined `awareness' state for recognizing the possible presence of signals of unknown types, which is otherwise rejected in a non-Bayesian model. Such data chunks labeled with the awareness state can then be further investigated rather than overlooked. Performance tests show that our model recognizes 90\% of the events when the optimal signal-to-noise ratio {$\rho$}opt {$>$}7 (100\% when {$\rho$}opt {$>$}8.5) and successfully labels more than 95\% of the waveform periods when {$\rho$}opt {$>$}8. The latency between the arrival of peak signal and generating an alert with the associated waveform period labeled is only about 20 seconds for an unoptimized code on a moderate GPU-equipped personal computer. This makes our model possible for nearly real-time detection and for forecasting the coalescence events when assisted with deeper training on a larger dataset using the state-of-art HPCs.},

  abstract = {Energy conservation is a basic physics principle, the breakdown of which often implies new physics. This paper presents a method for data-driven "new physics" discovery. Specifically, given a trajectory governed by unknown forces, our Neural New-Physics Detector (NNPhD) aims to detect new physics by decomposing the force field into conservative and non-conservative components, which are represented by a Lagrangian Neural Network (LNN) and a universal approximator network (UAN), respectively, trained to minimize the force recovery error plus a constant {$\lambda$} times the magnitude of the predicted non-conservative force. We show that a phase transition occurs at {$\lambda$}=1, universally for arbitrary forces. We demonstrate that NNPhD successfully discovers new physics in toy numerical experiments, rediscovering friction (1493) from a damped double pendulum, Neptune from Uranus' orbit (1846) and gravitational waves (2017) from an inspiraling orbit. We also show how NNPhD coupled with an integrator outperforms previous methods for predicting the future of a damped double pendulum.},

  abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions is a challenging task, yet to be achieved, in which it is key the connection between multiple messengers, including neutrinos and electromagnetic signals. In this work, we present a method for detecting these kind of signals based on machine learning techniques. We tested its robustness by injecting signals in the real noise data taken by the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network during the second observation run, O2. We trained a newly developed Mini-Inception Resnet neural network using time-frequency images corresponding to injections of simulated phenomenological signals, which mimic the waveforms obtained in 3D numerical simulations of CCSNe. With this algorithm we were able to identify signals from both our phenomenological template bank and from actual numerical 3D simulations of CCSNe. We computed the detection efficiency versus the source distance, obtaining that, for signal to noise ratio higher than 15, the detection efficiency is 70 \% at a false alarm rate lower than 5\%. We notice also that, in the case of O2 run, it would have been possible to detect signals emitted at 1 kpc of distance, whilst lowering down the efficiency to 60\%, the event distance reaches values up to 14 kpc.},

The coherent WaveBurst algorithm currently employed in the all-sky short-duration gravitational wave burst search uses a conditional approach on a selected attributes in the multi-dimensional event attribute space to distinguish between noisy event from that of astrophysical origin. We have been developing a supervised machine learning approach based on the Gaussian mixture modeling to model the attribute space for signals as well as noise events to enhance the probability of burst detection. We further extend the GMM approach to the all-sky short-duration coherent WaveBurst search as a post-processing step on events from the first half of the third observing run (O3a). We show an improvement in sensitivity to generic gravitational wave burst signal morphologies as well as the astrophysical source such as core-collapse supernova models due to the application of our Gaussian mixture model approach to coherent WaveBurst triggers. The Gaussian mixture model method recovers the gravitational wave signals from massive compact binary coalescences identified by coherent WaveBurst targeted for binary black holes in GWTC-2, with better significance than the all-sky coherent WaveBurst search. No additional significant gravitational wave bursts are observed.},

With some having morphology similar to high mass, high mass-ratio, and extreme-spin binary black hole events, they limit sensitivity to such sources. They can also act as a contaminant for all sources, requiring targeted mitigation before astrophysical inferences can be made. We propose a data driven, parametric model for frequently encountered glitch types using probabilistic principal component analysis. As a noise analog of parameterized gravitational wave signal models, it can be easily incorporated into existing search and detector characterization techniques. We have implemented our approach with the open source glitschen package. Using LIGO's currently most problematic glitch types, the 'blip' and 'tomte', we demonstrate that parametric models of modest dimension can be constructed and used for effective mitigation in both frequentist and Bayesian analyses.},

Due to its sensitivity, LIGO is prone to the disturbance of external noises which affects the data being collected to detect the gravitational wave. These noises are commonly called by the LIGO community as glitches. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effeciency of various deep trasnfer learning models namely VGG19, ResNet50V2, VGG16 and ResNet101 to detect glitch waveform in gravitational wave data. The accuracy achieved by the said models are 98.98\%, 98.35\%, 97.56\% and 94.73\% respectively.

Denoising of detector data is especially relevant during low-latency operations because electromagnetic follow-up of candidate detections requires accurate, rapid sky localization and inference of astrophysical sources. NNETFIX is a machine learning, artificial neural network-based algorithm designed to estimate the data containing a transient GW signal with an overlapping glitch as though the glitch was absent. The sky localization calculated from the denoised data may be significantly more accurate than the sky localization obtained from the original data or by removing the portion of the data impacted by the glitch. We test NNETFIX in simulated scenarios of binary black hole coalescence signals and discuss the potential for its use in future low-latency LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA searches. In the majority of cases for signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, we find that the overlap of the sky maps obtained with the denoised data and the original data is better than the overlap of the sky maps obtained with the original data and the data with the glitch removed.},

We used Morlet wavelets to convert strain time series to time-frequency images. Moreover, we only worked with data of non-Gaussian noise and hardware injections, removing freedom to set signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in GW templates by hand, in order to reproduce more realistic experimental conditions. After hyperparameter adjustments, we found that resampling through repeated k-fold cross-validation smooths the stochasticity of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent present in accuracy perturbations by a factor of 3.6.

  abstract = {As of this moment, 50 gravitational wave (GW) detections have been announced, thanks to the observational efforts of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, working with the Advanced LIGO and the Advanced Virgo interferometers. The detection of signals is complicated by the noise-dominated nature of the data. Conventional approaches in GW detection procedures require either precise knowledge of the GW waveform in the context of matched filtering searches or coincident analysis of data from multiple detectors. Furthermore, the analysis is prone to contamination by instrumental or environmental artifacts called glitches which either mimic astrophysical signals or reduce the overall quality of data. In this paper, we propose an alternative generic method of studying GW data based on detecting anomalies. The anomalies we study are transient signals, different from the slow non-stationary noise of the detector. The anomalies presented in the manuscript are mostly based on the GW emitted by the mergers of binary black hole systems. However, the presented study of anomalies is not limited only to GW alone, but also includes glitches occurring in the real LIGO/Virgo dataset available at the Gravitational Waves Open Science Center. To search for anomalies we employ deep learning algorithms, namely convolutional autoencoders, which are trained on both simulated and real detector data. We demonstrate the capabilities of our deep learning implementation in the reconstruction of injected signals. We study the influence of the GW strength, defined in terms of matched filter signal-to-noise ratio, on the detection of anomalies. Moreover, we present the application of our method for the localization in time of anomalies in the studied time-series data. We validate the results of anomaly searches on real data containing confirmed gravitational wave detections; we thus prove the generalization capabilities of our method, towards detecting GWs unknown to our deep learning models during training.},

We develop a custom architecture to analyze the data from two interferometers. We compare the obtained performance to that obtained with other AE architectures and with a convolutional classifier. The unsupervised nature of the proposed strategy comes with a cost in terms of accuracy, when compared to more traditional supervised techniques. On the other hand, there is a qualitative gain in generalizing the experimental sensitivity beyond the ensemble of pre-computed signal templates. The recurrent AE outperforms other AEs based on different architectures.

  abstract = {We present Quasarnet, a novel research platform that enables deployment of data-driven modeling techniques for the investigation of the properties of super-massive black holes. Black hole data sets \textendash{} observations and simulations \textendash{} have grown rapidly in the last decade in both complexity and abundance. However, our computational environments and tool sets have not matured commensurately to exhaust opportunities for discovery with these data. Our pilot study presented here is motivated by one of the fundamental open questions in understanding black hole formation and assembly across cosmic time - the nature of the black hole host galaxy and parent dark matter halo connection. To explore this, we combine and co-locate large, observational data sets of quasars, the high-redshift luminous population of accreting black holes, at z \textquestiondown{} 3 alongside simulated data spanning the same cosmic epochs in Quasarnet. We demonstrate the extraction of the properties of observed quasars and their putative dark matter parent halos that permit studying their association and correspondence. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and operation of the publicly queryable Quasarnet database and provide examples of query types and visualizations that can be used to explore the data. Starting with data collated in Quasarnet, which will serve as training sets, we plan to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict properties of the as yet undetected, less luminous quasar population. To that ultimate goal, here we present the first key step in building the BH-galaxy-halo connection that underpins the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. All our codes and compiled data are available on the public Google Kaggle Platform.},

  abstract = {Recently, artificial neural networks have been gaining momentum in the field of gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of computationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and merger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network, which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1~ms on a desktop GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods. We anticipate the existence of analogous underlying structures and corresponding computational gains also in the case of spinning black hole binaries.},

  abstract = {Low-latency gravitational wave search pipelines such as LLOID take advantage of low-rank factorization of the template matrix via singular value decomposition (SVD). With unprecedented improvements in detector bandwidth and sensitivity in advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors, one expects several orders of magnitude increase in the size of template banks. This poses a formidable computational challenge in factorizing extremely large matrices. Previously, [in Kulkarni et al. [6]], we introduced the idea of random projection (RP)-based matrix factorization as a computationally viable alternative to SVD, for such large template banks. In this follow-up paper, we demonstrate the application of a block-wise randomized matrix factorization (RMF) scheme using which one can compute the desired low-rank factorization corresponding to a fixed average SNR loss (h{$\delta$}{\r h}o/{\r h}oi). Unlike the SVD approach, this new scheme affords a much more efficient way of matrix factorization especially in the context of LLOID search pipelines. It is a well-known fact that for very large template banks, the total computational cost is dominated by the cost of reconstruction of the detection statistic and that the cost of filtering the data is insignificant in comparison. We are unaware of any previous work in literature that has tried to squarely address this issue of optimizing the reconstruction cost. We provide a possible solution to reduce the reconstruction cost using the matching pursuit(MP) algorithm. We show that it is possible to approximately reconstruct the time-series of the detection statistic at a fraction of the total cost using our MP algorithm. The combination of RMF along with MP can handle large template banks more efficiently in comparison to the direct application of SVD. Results from several numerical simulations have been presented to demonstrate their efficacy.},

To alleviate this issue, we present a deep learning method for rapidly searching for signals of massive black hole binaries in gravitational wave data. Our model is capable of processing a year of data, simulated from the LISA data challenge, in only several seconds, while identifying all coalescences of massive black hole binaries with no false alarms. We further demonstrate that the model shows robust resistance to a wide range of generalization cases, including various waveform families and updated instrumental configurations.

  abstract = {In the data of laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors, transient noise with non-stationary and non-Gaussian features occurs at a high rate. It often causes problems such as instability of the detector, hiding and/or imitating gravitational-wave signals. This transient noise has various characteristics in the time-frequency representation, which is considered to be associated with environmental and instrumental origins. Classification of transient noise can offer one of the clues for exploring its origin and improving the performance of the detector. One approach for the classification of these noises is supervised learning. However, generally, supervised learning requires annotation of the training data, and there are issues with ensuring objectivity in the classification and its corresponding new classes. On the contrary, unsupervised learning can reduce the annotation work for the training data and ensuring objectivity in the classification and its corresponding new classes. In this study, we propose an architecture for the classification of transient noise by using unsupervised learning, which combines a variational autoencoder and invariant information clustering. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we used the dataset (time-frequency two-dimensional spectrogram images and labels) of the LIGO first observation run prepared by the Gravity Spy project. We obtain the consistency between the label annotated by Gravity Spy project and the class provided by our proposed unsupervised learning architecture and provide the potential for the existence of the unrevealed classes.},

The most sensitive search algorithms convolve many different pre-calculated gravitational waveforms with the detector data and look for coincident matches between different detectors. Machine learning is being explored as an alternative approach to building a search algorithm that has the prospect to reduce computational costs and target more complex signals. In this work we construct a two-detector search for gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using neural networks trained on non-spinning binary black hole data from a single detector. The network is applied to the data from both observatories independently and we check for events coincident in time between the two. This enables the efficient analysis of large quantities of background data by time-shifting the independent detector data. We find that while for a single detector the network retains 91.5\% of the sensitivity matched filtering can achieve, this number drops to 83.9\% for two observatories. To enable the network to check for signal consistency in the detectors, we then construct a set of simple networks that operate directly on data from both detectors. We find that none of these simple two-detector networks are capable of improving the sensitivity over applying networks individually to the data from the detectors and searching for time coincidences.},

Extracting these signals from the instruments' background noise is a complex problem and the computational cost of most current searches depends on the complexity of the source model. Deep learning may be capable of finding signals where current algorithms hit computational limits. Here we restrict our analysis to signals from non-spinning binary black holes and systematically test different strategies by which training data is presented to the networks. To assess the impact of the training strategies, we re-analyze the first published networks and directly compare them to an equivalent matched-filter search. We find that the deep learning algorithms can generalize low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals to high SNR ones but not vice versa. As such, it is not beneficial to provide high SNR signals during training, and fastest convergence is achieved when low SNR samples are provided early on. During testing we found that the networks are sometimes unable to recover any signals when a false alarm probability \textexclamdown 10{$^{-3}$} is required. We resolve this restriction by applying a modification we call unbounded Softmax replacement (USR) after training. With this alteration we find that the machine learning search retains {$\geq$} 97.5\% of the sensitivity of the matched-filter search down to a false-alarm rate of 1 per month.},

The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the {$\sim$}10{$^{-3}$} level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors.

  abstract = {Detecting continuous nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) generated by individual close binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) is one of the primary objectives of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The detection sensitivity is slated to increase significantly as the number of well-timed millisecond pulsars will increase by more than an order of magnitude with the advent of next-generation radio telescopes. Currently, the Bayesian analysis pipeline using parallel tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo has been applied in multiple studies for CB-SMBH searches, but it may be challenged by the high dimensionality of the parameter space for future large-scale PTAs. One solution is to reduce the dimensionality by maximizing or marginalizing over uninformative parameters semianalytically, but it is not clear whether this approach can be extended to more complex signal models without making overly simplified assumptions. Recently, the method of diffusive nested (DNest) sampling has shown capability in coping with high dimensionality and multimodality effectively in Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we apply DNest to search for continuous GWs in simulated pulsar timing residuals and find that it performs well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency for a PTA including pulsars. DNest also allows a simultaneous search of multiple sources elegantly, which demonstrates its scalability and general applicability. Our results show that it is convenient and also highly beneficial to include DNest in current toolboxes of PTA analysis.},

We find that fast scattering/crown, linked to ground motion at the detector sites, is especially prevalent, and identify two subclasses linked to different types of ground motion. Reclassification of data based on the updated model finds that {$\sim$}27\% of all transient noise at LIGO Livingston belongs to the fast scattering class, while {$\sim$}8\% belongs to the low-frequency blip class, making them the most frequent and fourth most frequent sources of transient noise at that site. Our results demonstrate both how glitch classification can reveal potential improvements to gravitational-wave detectors, and how, given an appropriate framework, citizen-science volunteers may make discoveries in large data sets.},

More precisely, our expressions are built from numerical surrogate models based on supercomputer simulations of the Einstein equations, which have been shown to be essentially indistinguishable from each other. Distinct aspects of our approach are that: (i) representations of the gravitational waves can be explicitly written in a few lines, (ii) these representations are free-form yet still fast to search for and validate and (iii) there are no underlying physical approximations in the underlying model. The key strategy is combining techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Reduced Order Modeling for parameterized systems. Namely, symbolic regression through genetic programming combined with sparse representations in parameter space and the time domain using Reduced Basis and the Empirical Interpolation Method enabling fast free-form symbolic searches and large-scale~a posteriori validations. As a proof of concept we present our results for the collision of two black holes, initially without spin, and with an initial separation corresponding to 25\textendash 31 gravitational wave cycles before merger. The minimum overlap, compared to ground truth solutions, is 99\%. That is, 1\% difference between our closed-form expressions and supercomputer simulations; this is considered for gravitational (GW) science more than the minimum required due to experimental numerical errors which otherwise dominate. This paper aims to contribute to the field of GWs in particular and Artificial Intelligence in general.},

The combination between a non-parametric method and the Hubble parameter data is investigated as a strategy to reconstruct cosmographic functions. In addition, our results are quite general because they are not restricted to a specific type of functional dependency of the Hubble parameter.

In particular, we use dense autoencoder networks to extract the parameters of interest from exponentially decaying signals and decaying oscillations. By using a three-stage training method and careful choice of the neural network size, we are able to retrieve the relevant signal parameters directly from the latent space of the autoencoder network at significantly improved rates compared to traditional algorithmic signal-analysis approaches. We show that the achievable precision and accuracy of this method of analysis is similar to conventional algorithm-based signal analysis methods, by demonstrating that the extracted signal parameters are approaching their fundamental parameter estimation limit as provided by the Cram\'er\textendash Rao bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder networks are able to achieve signal analysis, and, hence, parameter extraction, at rates of 75 kHz, orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional techniques with similar precision. Finally, our exploration of the limitations of our approach in different computational systems suggests that analysis rates of 200 kHz are feasible using neural networks in systems where the transfer time between the data-acquisition system and data-analysis modules can be kept below {$\sim$}3 \textmu s.},

We have also benchmarked the performance of this new methodology by processing 200 hours of open source, advanced LIGO noise from August 2017. Our findings indicate that our approach identifies real gravitational wave sources in advanced LIGO data with a false positive rate of 1 misclassification for every 2.7 days of searched data. A follow up of these misclassifications identified them as glitches. Our deep learning ensemble represents the first class of neural network classifiers that are trained with millions of modeled waveforms that describe quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing, binary black hole mergers. Once fully trained, our deep learning ensemble processes advanced LIGO strain data faster than real-time using 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.},

From the corresponding electromagnetic (EM) counterpart detectors for each networks, we sample the joint GW+EM detections from the probability to construct the Hubble diagram of standard sirens for 10 years detections of HLVKI, 5 years detections of ET+2CE, and 5 years of detections of LISA+Taiji, which we estimate would be available and released in the 2030s. Thus we construct a combined Hubble diagram from these ground and spaced-based detector networks to explore the expansion history of our Universe from redshift 0 to 7. We give a conservative and realistic estimation of the catalogue and Hubble diagram of GW standard sirens and their potential on studying cosmology and modified gravity theory in the 2030s. We adopt two strategies for the forecasts. One is the traditional model-fitting Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo method (MCMC). The results show that the combined StS alone can constrain the Hubble constant at the precision level of 0.34\%, 1.76 times more tightly than the current most precise measurement from Planck+BAO+Pantheon. The joint StS with current EM experiments will improve the constraints of cosmological parameters significantly. The modified gravity theory can be constrained with 0.46\% error from the GW propagation. In the second strategy, we use the machine-learning nonparametric reconstruction techniques, i.e., the Gaussian process (GP) with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a comparison. GP reconstructions can give comparable results with MCMC. We anticipate more works and research on these topics.},

  abstract = {The success of the multi-messenger astronomy relies on gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO and Virgo to provide prompt warning of merger events involving neutron stars (including both binary neutron stars and neutron-star-black-holes), which further depends critically on the low-frequency sensitivity of LIGO as a typical binary neutron star stays in this band for minutes. However, the current sub-60 Hz sensitivity of LIGO has not yet reached its design target and the excess noise can be more than an order of magnitude below 20 Hz. It is limited by nonlinearly coupled noises from auxiliary control loops which are also nonstationary, posing challenges to realistic early-warning pipelines. Nevertheless, machine-learning-based neural networks provide ways to simultaneously improve the low-frequency sensitivity and mitigate its nonstationarity, and detect the real-time gravitational-wave signal with a very short computational time. We propose to achieve this by inputting both the main gravitational-wave readout and key auxiliary witnesses to a compound neural network. Using simulated data with characteristic representing the real LIGO detectors, our machine-learning-based neural networks can reduce nonlinearly coupled noise by about a factor of 5 and allows a typical binary neutron star (neutron-star-black-hole) to be detected 100 s (10 s) before the merger at a distance of 40 Mpc (160 Mpc). If one can further reduce the noise to the fundamental limit, our neural networks can achieve detection out to a distance of 80 Mpc and 240 Mpc for binary neutron stars and neutron-star-black-holes, respectively. It thus demonstrates that utilizing machine-learning-based neural networks is a promising direction for the timely detection of the coalescence of electromagnetically bright LIGO/Virgo sources.},

We also investigate the responses of the glitches with different frequency. We find that when the frequency of the glitches falls in that of the trained GW signals, the false alarm probability of the glitches will be much larger than that of the LIGO-like noises, and the probability of the glitches being misjudged as the GW signals may even exceed 30\%.},

This is due to the large template bank required and the difficulties in waveforms modelling. In contrast, machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown a promising alternative for GWs data analysis, where ML can be used in developing semi-automatic and automatic tools for the detection and parameter estimation of GWs sources. Compared to second generation detectors, ET will have a wider accessible frequency band but also a lower noise. The ET will have a detection rate for Binary Black Holes (BBHs) and Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) of order 105 - 106year-1 and 7 \texttimes{} 104year-1 respectively. We explored the efficiency of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of BBHs' mergers in synthetic noisy data that was generated according to ET's parameters. Without performing data whitening or applying bandpass filtering, we trained four CNN networks with the state-of-the-art performance in computer vision, namely VGG, ResNet and DenseNet. ResNet has significantly better performance, and was able to detect BBHs sources with SNR of 8 or higher with 98.5\% accuracy, and with 92.5\%, 85\%, 60\% and 62\% accuracy for sources with SNR range of 7-8, 6-7, 5-6 and 4-5 respectively.

We design and develop a deep learning system to classification gravitational waves of the dataset `Gravity Spy (Gravitational waves)' that is made up of the LIGO images. The goals of this research are to gain a piece of reasonable and useful knowledge about Gravitational waves and propose an effective deep learning network system to classify the gravitational waves. The accuracy achieved by our model is 99.34\%.},

  abstract = {All scientific claims of gravitational wave discovery to date rely on the offline statistical analysis of candidate observations in order to quantify significance relative to background processes. The current foundation in such offline detection pipelines in experiments at LIGO is the matched-filter algorithm, which produces a signal-to-noise-ratio-based statistic for ranking candidate observations. Existing deep-learning-based attempts to detect gravitational waves, which have shown promise in both signal sensitivity and computational efficiency, output probability scores. However, probability scores are not easily integrated into discovery workflows, limiting the use of deep learning thus far to non-discovery-oriented applications. In this paper, the Deep Learning Signal-to-Noise Ratio (DeepSNR) detection pipeline, which uses a novel method for generating a signal-to-noise ratio ranking statistic from deep learning classifiers, is introduced, providing the first foundation for the use of deep learning algorithms in discovery-oriented pipelines. The performance of DeepSNR is demonstrated by identifying binary black hole merger candidates versus noise sources in open LIGO data from the first observation run. High-fidelity simulations of the LIGO detector responses are used to present the first sensitivity estimates of deep learning models in terms of physical observables. The robustness of DeepSNR under various experimental considerations is also investigated. The results pave the way for DeepSNR to be used in the scientific discovery of gravitational waves and rare signals in broader contexts, potentially enabling the detection of fainter signals and never-before-observed phenomena.},

  abstract = {Interferometric gravitational-wave observatories have opened a new era in astronomy. The rich data produced by an international network enables detailed analysis of the curved space-time around black holes. With nearly one hundred signals observed so far and thousands expected in the next decade, their population properties enable insights into stellar evolution and the expansion of our Universe. However, the detectors are afflicted by transient noise artefacts known as "glitches" which contaminate the signals and bias inferences. Of the 90 signals detected to date, 18 were contaminated by glitches. This feasibility study explores a new approach to transient gravitational-wave data analysis using Gaussian processes, which model the underlying physics of the glitch-generating mechanism rather than the explicit realisation of the glitch itself. We demonstrate that if the Gaussian process kernel function can adequately model the glitch morphology, we can recover the parameters of simulated signals. Moreover, we find that the Gaussian processes kernels used in this work are well-suited to modelling long-duration glitches which are most challenging for existing glitch-mitigation approaches. Finally, we show how the time-domain nature of our approach enables a new class of time-domain tests of General Relativity, performing a re-analysis of the inspiral-merger-ringdown test on the first observed binary black hole merger. Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the Gaussian processes as an alternative to the traditional framework but does not yet establish them as a replacement. Therefore, we conclude with an outlook on the steps needed to realise the full potential of the Gaussian process approach.},

The detection of the GW190425 event is less successful, which attests to performance degradation with the signal-to-noise ratio.

The proposed models can transfer knowledge from the domain of known classes to a new domain where the classes are unknown. A clustering algorithm is further applied in the new domain to find potentially new classes from the pool of unlabeled data. The research problem and data for this paper originated from the Gravity Spy project which is a side project of Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The LIGO project aims at detecting cosmic gravitational waves using huge detectors. However non-cosmic, non-Gaussian disturbances known as "glitches", show up in gravitational-wave data of LIGO. This is undesirable as it creates problems for the gravitational wave detection process. Gravity Spy aids in glitch identification with the purpose of understanding their origin. Since new types of glitches appear over time, one of the objective of Gravity Spy is to create new glitch classes. Towards this task, we offer a methodology in this paper to accomplish this.},

Our new network is able to search for any type of binary neutron stars, it can take into account all the detectors available, and it can see the events even earlier than the previous one. We study the performance of our method in three different types of noise: Gaussian O3 noise, real O3 noise, and predicted O4 noise. We show that our network performs almost as well in non-Gaussian noise as in Gaussian noise: our method is robust w.r.t. glitches and artifacts present in real noise. Although it would not have been able to trigger on the BNSs detected during O3 because their signal-to-noise ratio was too weak, we expect our network to find around 3 BNSs during O4 with a time before the merger between 3 and 88 s in advance.},

  abstract = {Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo ground-based interferometers are poised to probe an unprecedentedly large volume of space, enhancing the discovery power of the observations to even new sources of gravitational wave emitters. In this scenario, the development of highly optimized gravitational wave detection algorithms is crucial. We propose a novel layered framework for real-time detection of gravitational waves inspired by speech processing techniques and, in the present implementation, based on a state-of-the-art machine learning approach involving a hybridization of genetic programming and neural networks. The key aspects of the newly proposed framework are: the well structured, layered approach, and the low computational complexity. The paper describes the basic concepts of the framework and the derivation of the first three layers. Even if, in the present implementation, the layers are based on models derived using a machine learning approach, the proposed layered structure has a universal nature. To train and test the models, we used simulated binary black hole gravitational wave waveforms in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity design. Compared to more complex approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, our framework, even using the simple ground model described in the paper, has similar performance but with a much lower computational complexity and a higher degree of modularity. Furthermore, the underlying exploitation of short-term features makes the results of the new framework virtually independent against time-position of gravitational wave signals, simplifying its future exploitation in real-time multi-layer pipelines for gravitational-wave detection with second generation interferometers.},

  abstract = {Gravitational wave bursts are transient signals distinct from compact binary mergers that arise from a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. Because most of these phenomena are poorly modeled, the use of traditional search methods such as matched filtering is excluded. Bursts include short (\${$<\$$}10 seconds) and long (from 10 to a few hundreds of seconds) duration signals for which the detection is constrained by environmental and instrumental transient noises called glitches. Glitches contaminate burst searches, reducing the amount of useful data and limiting the sensitivity of current algorithms. It is therefore of primordial importance to locate and distinguish them from potential burst signals. In this paper, we propose to train a convolutional neural network to detect glitches in the time-frequency space of the cross-correlated LIGO noise. We show that our network is retrieving more than 95\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the glitches while being trained only on a subset of the existing glitch classes highlighting the sensitivity of the network to completely new glitch classes.},

In opposition to compact binary mergers, their GW signals cover a wide range of poorly understood astrophysical phenomena such as accretion disk instabilities and magnetar flares. The lack of accurate and rapidly generated gravitational-wave emission models prevents the use of matched filtering methods. Such events are thus probed through the template-free excess-power method, consisting in searching for a local excess of power in the time-frequency space correlated between detectors. The problem can be viewed as a search for high-value clustered pixels within an image, which has been generally tackled by deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this work, we use a CNN as a anomaly detection tool for the long-duration searches. We show that it can reach a pixel-wise detection despite trained with minimal assumptions, while being able to retrieve both astrophysical signals and noise transients originating from instrumental coupling within the detectors. We also note that our neural network can extrapolate and connect partially disjoint signal tracks in the time-frequency plane.},

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to detect sufficient EMRIs to probe the underlying source population, testing theories of the formation and evolution of MBHs and their environments. Population studies are subject to selection effects that vary across the EMRI parameter space, which bias inference results if unaccounted for. This bias can be corrected, but evaluating the detectability of many EMRI signals is computationally expensive. We mitigate this cost by (i) constructing a rapid and accurate neural network interpolator capable of predicting the signal-to-noise ratio of an EMRI from its parameters, and (ii) further accelerating detectability estimation with a neural network that learns the selection function, leveraging our first neural network for data generation. The resulting framework rapidly estimates the selection function, enabling a full treatment of EMRI detectability in population inference analyses. We apply our method to an astrophysically motivated EMRI population model, demonstrating the potential selection biases and subsequently correcting for them. Accounting for selection effects, we predict that LISA will measure the MBH mass function slope to a precision of 8.8\%, the CO mass function slope to a precision of 4.6\%, the width of the MBH spin magnitude distribution to a precision of 10\% and the event rate to a precision of 12\% with EMRIs at redshifts below z=6.},

Rapid sky localization of these sources is crucial to facilitate such multi-messenger observations. Since GWs from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can spend up to 10-15 mins in the frequency bands of the detectors at design sensitivity, early warning alerts and pre-merger sky localization can be achieved for sufficiently bright sources, as demonstrated in recent studies. In this work, we present pre-merger BNS sky localization results using CBC-SkyNet, a deep learning model capable of inferring sky location posterior distributions of GW sources at orders of magnitude faster speeds than standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We test our model's performance on a catalog of simulated injections from Sachdev et al. (2020), recovered at 0-60 secs before merger, and obtain comparable sky localization areas to the rapid localization tool BAYESTAR. These results show the feasibility of our model for rapid pre-merger sky localization and the possibility of follow-up observations for precursor emissions from BNS mergers.},

  abstract = {The mergers of neutron star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries are the most promising gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts. The rapid detection, localization and simultaneous multi-messenger follow-up of these sources is of primary importance in the upcoming science runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. While prompt electromagnetic counterparts during binary mergers can last less than two seconds, the time scales of existing localization methods that use Bayesian techniques, varies from seconds to days. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning-based approach for rapid and accurate sky localization of all types of binary coalescences, including neutron star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries for the first time. Specifically, we train and test a normalizing flow model on matched-filtering output from gravitational wave searches. Our model produces sky direction posteriors in milliseconds using a single P100 GPU, which is three to six orders of magnitude faster than Bayesian techniques.},

  abstract = {Blip glitches, a type of short-duration noise transient in the LIGO--Virgo data, are a nuisance for the binary black hole (BBH) searches. They affect the BBH search sensitivity significantly because their time-domain morphologies are very similar, and that creates difficulty in vetoing them. In this work, we construct a deep-learning neural network to efficiently distinguish BBH signals from blip glitches. We introduce sine-Gaussian projection (SGP) maps, which are projections of GW frequency-domain data snippets on a basis of sine-Gaussians defined by the quality factor and central frequency. We feed the SGP maps to our deep-learning neural network, which classifies the BBH signals and blips. Whereas the BBH signals are simulated, the blips used are taken from real data throughout our analysis. We show that our network significantly improves the identification of the BBH signals in comparison to the results obtained using traditional-\$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ and sine-Gaussian \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$. For example, our network improves the sensitivity by 75\% at a false-positive rate of \$10\^\{-2\}\$ for BBHs with total mass in the range \$[80,140]\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and SNR in the range \$[3,8]\$. Also, it correctly identifies 95\% of the real GW events in GWTC-3. The computation time for classification is a few minutes for thousands of SGP maps on a single core. With further optimisation in the next version of our algorithm, we expect a further reduction in the computational cost. Our proposed method can potentially improve the veto process in the LIGO--Virgo GW data analysis and conceivably support identifying GW signals in low-latency pipelines.},

  abstract = {As our ability to sense increases, we are experiencing a transition from data-poor problems, in which the central issue is a lack of relevant data, to data-rich problems, in which the central issue is to identify a few relevant features in a sea of observations. Motivated by applications in gravitational-wave astrophysics, we study the problem of predicting the presence of transient noise artifacts in a gravitational wave detector from a rich collection of measurements from the detector and its environment. We argue that feature learning--in which relevant features are optimized from data--is critical to achieving high accuracy. We introduce models that reduce the error rate by over 60\textbackslash\% compared to the previous state of the art, which used fixed, hand-crafted features. Feature learning is useful not only because it improves performance on prediction tasks; the results provide valuable information about patterns associated with phenomena of interest that would otherwise be undiscoverable. In our application, features found to be associated with transient noise provide diagnostic information about its origin and suggest mitigation strategies. Learning in high-dimensional settings is challenging. Through experiments with a variety of architectures, we identify two key factors in successful models: sparsity, for selecting relevant variables within the high-dimensional observations; and depth, which confers flexibility for handling complex interactions and robustness with respect to temporal variations. We illustrate their significance through systematic experiments on real detector data. Our results provide experimental corroboration of common assumptions in the machine-learning community and have direct applicability to improving our ability to sense gravitational waves, as well as to many other problem settings with similarly high-dimensional, noisy, or partly irrelevant data.},

Among the most sensitive and complex systems of our civilization are the detectors that search for incredibly small variations in distance caused by gravitational waves -- phenomena originally predicted by Albert Einstein to emerge and propagate through the universe as the result of collisions between black holes and other massive objects in deep space. The extreme complexity and precision of such detectors causes them to be subject to transient noise issues that can significantly limit their sensitivity and effectiveness. In this work, we present a demonstration of a method that can detect and characterize emergent transient anomalies of such massively complex systems. We illustrate the performance, precision, and adaptability of the automated solution via one of the prevalent issues limiting gravitational-wave discoveries: noise artifacts of terrestrial origin that contaminate gravitational wave observatories' highly sensitive measurements and can obscure or even mimic the faint astrophysical signals for which they are listening. Specifically, we demonstrate how a highly interpretable convolutional classifier can automatically learn to detect transient anomalies from auxiliary detector data without needing to observe the anomalies themselves. We also illustrate several other useful features of the model, including how it performs automatic variable selection to reduce tens of thousands of auxiliary data channels to only a few relevant ones; how it identifies behavioral signatures predictive of anomalies in those channels; and how it can be used to investigate individual anomalies and the channels associated with them.},

Here we present a new method for efficiently generating template banks that utilizes automatic differentiation to calculate the parameter space metric. Principally, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation enables accurate computation of the metric for waveforms currently used in search pipelines, whilst being computationally cheap. Additionally, by combining random template placement and a Monte Carlo method for evaluating the fraction of the parameter space that is currently covered, we show that search-ready template banks for frequency-domain waveforms can be rapidly generated. Finally, we argue that differentiable waveforms offer a pathway to accelerating stochastic placement algorithms. We implement all our methods into an easy-to-use Python package based on the jax framework, diffbank, to allow the community to easily take advantage of differentiable waveforms for future searches.},

These data quality streams allow candidates identified in the data during periods of detector malfunctions to be more efficiently rejected as noise. This method allows data from machine learning predictions of the detector state to be included as part of the PyCBC search, increasing the the total number of detectable gravitational-wave signals by up to 5\%. When both machine learning classifications and manually-generated flags are used to search data from LIGO-Virgo's third observing run, the total number of detectable gravitational-wave signals is increased by up to 20\% compared to not using any data quality streams.

An ablation study is used to compare the effects of including adversarial feedback from an auxiliary derivative discriminator with a vanilla two-player WGAN. We show that discriminating on derivatives can stabilize the learning of GAN components on 1D continuous signals during their training phase. This results in smoother generated signals that are less distinguishable from real samples and better capture the distributions of the training data. DVGAN is also used to simulate real transient noise events captured in the advanced LIGO GW detector.},

Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions. With GWTC-3, we report the same features previously recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$\{\textbackslash sim\}35\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary masses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power law. We infer a distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment, supporting conclusions of recent work. We find broad agreement with the previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small (\$a{$<$}0.5\$), the distribution peaks at \$a\textbackslash sim0.2\$, and there is mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. With a modulated power law describing the BBH merger rate's evolution in redshift, we see hints of the rate evolution either flattening or decreasing at \$z\textbackslash sim0.2-0.5\$, but the full distribution remains entirely consistent with a monotonically increasing power law. We conclude with a discussion of the astrophysical context of our new findings and how non-parametric methods in gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely poised to complement to the parametric approach as we enter the data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.},

Since numerical relativity is the only way to fully solve the non-linear merger regime of general relativity for comparably massed systems, numerical relativity simulations are critical for gravitational wave detection and analysis. These simulations are computationally expensive, with each simulation placing one point within the high dimensional parameter space of binary black hole coalescences. This makes it important to have a method of placing new simulations in ways that use our computational resources optimally while ensuring sufficient coverage of the parameter space. Accomplishing this requires predicting the impact of a new set of parameters before performing the simulation. To this effect, this paper introduces a neural network to predict the mismatch between the gravitational waves of two binary systems. Using this network, we then show how we can propose new numerical relativity simulations that will provide the most benefit. We also use the network to identify gaps in existing public catalogs and identify degeneracies in the binary black hole parameter space.},

The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the experiment that performed such detections, has two observatories, one in Hanford-WA and another in Livingston-LA, and operates as a Michelson\textendash Morley interferometer with 4 km-long arms. Each observatory can measure variations in its arm lengths which are 10\,000 times smaller than a proton diameter. Because LIGO has such a high sensitivity to length changes, many noise sources such as environmental effects, instrumental misbehavior, and human activities may also interfere. Studying these local intrusions, which we generically call glitches, remains a big challenge for LIGO Scientific Collaboration since they can mimic gravitational waves, polluting the data and decreasing the statistical significance of a signal. This paper compares two methods of glitch classification for nine classes by using glitchgrams. A glitchgram is constructed using only Omicron triggers and represents an event in the time, frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio space. The first method uses the cosine similarity, and the second uses support vector machine (SVM) from an application of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, an unsupervised machine learning technique. The results from each method are compared with Gravity Spy classifications.},

We demonstrate, that the residual error of an artificial neural network that models the coefficients of the surrogate waveform expansion (especially those of the phase of the waveform) has sufficient structure to be learnable by a second network. Adding this second network, we were able to reduce the maximum mismatch for waveforms in a validation set by more than an order of magnitude. We also explored several other ideas for improving the accuracy of the surrogate model, such as the exploitation of similarities between waveforms, the augmentation of the training set, the dissection of the input space, using dedicated networks per output coefficient and output augmentation. In several cases, small improvements can be observed, but the most significant improvement still comes from the addition of a second network that models the residual error. Since the residual error for more general surrogate waveform models (when e.g. eccentricity is included) may also have a specific structure, one can expect our method to be applicable to cases where the gain in accuracy could lead to significant gains in computational time.},

  abstract = {Current gravitational wave (GW) detections rely on the existence of libraries of theoretical waveforms. Consequently, finding new physics with GWs requires libraries of non-standard models, which are computationally demanding. We discuss how deep learning frameworks can be used to generate new waveforms "learned" from a simulation dataset obtained, say, from numerical relativity simulations. Concretely, we use the WaveGAN architecture of a generative adversarial network (GAN). As a proof of concept we provide this neural network (NN) with a sample of (\${$>$}500\$) waveforms from the collisions of exotic compact objects (Proca stars), obtained from numerical relativity simulations. Dividing the sample into a training and a validation set, we show that after a sufficiently large number of training epochs the NN can produce from 12\textbackslash\% to 25\textbackslash\% of the synthetic waveforms with an overlapping match of at least 95\textbackslash\% with the ones from the validation set. We also demonstrate that a NN can be used to predict the overlapping match score, with 90\textbackslash\% of accuracy, of new synthetic samples. These are encouraging results for using GANs for data augmentation and interpolation in the context of GWs, to cover the full parameter space of, say, exotic compact binaries, without the need of intensive numerical relativity simulations.},

Here we investigate whether it is possible for the current generation of detectors to distinguish between very short-lived gravitational wave signals from mergers between high-mass black holes, and the signal produced by a close encounter between two black holes which results in gravitational capture, and ultimately a merger. We compare the posterior probability distributions produced by analysing simulated signals from both types of progenitor events, both under ideal and realistic scenarios. We show that while, under ideal conditions it is possible to distinguish both progenitors, under more realistic conditions they are indistinguishable. This has important implications for the interpretation of such short signals, and we therefore advocate that these signals be the focus of additional investigation even when satisfactory results have been achieved from standard analyses.},

According to the results, the 41 confirmed GW events of BBH mergers can be classified successfully by our CNN model. Furthermore, through restricting the number of consecutive prewarning from sequential samples intercepted continuously in LIGO O2 real time-series and vetoing the coincidences of noise from H and L, the FAR is limited to be less than once in 2 months. It is helpful to promote LIGO real time data processing.},

PMC utilises a Normalising Flow (NF) in order to decorrelate the parameters of the distribution and then proceeds by sampling from the preconditioned target distribution using an adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) scheme. The results produced by PMC include samples from the posterior distribution and an estimate of the model evidence that can be used for parameter inference and model comparison respectively. The aforementioned framework has been thoroughly tested in a variety of challenging target distributions achieving state-of-the-art sampling performance. In the cases of primordial feature analysis and gravitational wave inference, PMC is approximately 50 and 25 times faster respectively than Nested Sampling (NS). We found that in higher dimensional applications the acceleration is even greater. Finally, PMC is directly parallelisable, manifesting linear scaling up to thousands of CPUs.},

The observed signal contained gravitational waves (GWs) and two types of noise: stationary and non-stationary noise. Both noise types must be removed to properly observe GWs. In this study, we characterized and imaged Gaussian noise, which is stationary noise, in the time\textendash frequency domain and removed it from the observed signals using a denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN). Furthermore, we verified its removal using non-harmonic analysis (NHA), which has a higher resolution than conventional methods such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform. The window length of the NHA and the visualization rate were varied to facilitate the removal. The system used was adapted to the model signal, i.e., the calculated GW and Gaussian noise, and the data observed by LIGO. This validation did not cover the data observed by Virgo. In experiments conducted with the model signal, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) increased by up to 12.16~dB (optimal SNR = 8). In the data observed by LIGO, the Gaussian noise was removed, whereas the GWs and glitches remained. Thus, we were able to eliminate the Gaussian noise in both the model signal and the observed signal. This system can potentially be used to discover astronomical events in the time\textendash frequency domain that cannot be estimated using matched filtering.},

Advantages of DL metric detectors are emphasized from a view point of general coordinate transformations. Two given metrics (two spacetimes) are defined to be conneted by a DL isometry if their geodesic image data cannot be discriminated by any DL metric detector at any time. The fundamental question of when the DL isometry appears is extensively explored. If the two spacetimes connected by the DL isometry are in superposition of quantum gravity theory, the post-measurement state may be still in the same superposition even after DL metric detectors observe the superposed state. We also demonstrate metric-detection DL's in 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes to estimate the cosmological constants and Brown-Henneaux charges. In the AdS/CFT correspondence dictionary, it may be expected that such metric detectors in the AdS bulk region correspond to quantum measurement devices in the CFT at the AdS boundary.},

However, the uncertainty of the estimated p-value for the median probability and error, ranging from 0 to 0.1, convinces us GW190707{$_0$}93326 is less likely a lensed event because it includes p {$\geq$} 0.05 where the unlensed hypothesis is true.

This technique allows us to extract the complex frequencies and separation constants of the equation without the need for sophisticated numerical techniques, and with an almost immediate implementation under the \textbackslash texttt\{PyTorch\} framework. We are able to compute the oscillation frequencies and damping times for arbitrary black hole spins and masses, with accuracy typically below the percentual level as compared to the accepted values in the literature. We find that PINN-computed quasi-normal modes are indistinguishable from those obtained through existing methods at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) larger than 100, making the former reliable for gravitational-wave data analysis in the mid term, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or the Einstein Telescope, where SNRs of \$\{\textbackslash cal O\}(1000)\$ might be achieved.},

Previous studies focused on a single deep learning model. In this paper we design an ensemble algorithm combining a set of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for GW signal recognition. The whole ensemble model consists of two sub-ensemble models. Each sub-ensemble model is also an ensemble model of deep learning. The two sub-ensemble models treat data of Hanford and Livinston detectors respectively. Proper voting scheme is adopted to combine the two sub-ensemble models to form the whole ensemble model. We apply this ensemble model to all reported GW events in the first observation and second observation runs (O1/O2) by LIGO-VIRGO Scientific Collaboration. We find that the ensemble algorithm can clearly identify all binary black hole merger events except GW170818. We also apply the ensemble model to one month (August 2017) data of O2. There is no false trigger happens although only O1 data are used for training. Our test results indicate that the ensemble learning algorithms can be used in real-time GW data analysis.},

The first network classifies spectra into five labels including \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM, \$f(R)\$, \$w\$CDM, Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) gravity and a "random" class whereas the second is trained to distinguish \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM from non-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. Both networks achieve a comparable training, validation and test accuracy of \$\textbackslash sim 95\textbackslash\%\$. Each network is also capable of detecting deviations from \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM that were not included in the training set, demonstrated with spectra generated using the growth-index \$\textbackslash gamma\$. We then quantify the constraining power of each network by computing the smallest deviation from \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM such that the noise-averaged non-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM classification probability is at least \$2\textbackslash sigma\$, finding these bounds to be \$f\_\{R0\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{-7\}\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{rc\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{-2\} \$, \$-1.05 \textbackslash lesssim w\_0 \textbackslash lesssim 0.95 \$, \$-0.2 \textbackslash lesssim w\_a \textbackslash lesssim 0.2 \$, \$0.52 \textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash gamma \textbackslash lesssim 0.59 \$.

These non-Gaussianities often match well with the template waveforms used in matched filter searches, and require signal-consistency tests to distinguish them from astrophysical signals. However, empirically tuning these tests for maximum efficacy is time consuming and limits the complexity of these tests. In this work we demonstrate a framework to use machine-learning techniques to automatically tune signal-consistency tests. We implement a new \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ signal-consistency test targeting the large population of noise found in searches for intermediate mass black hole binaries, training the new test using the framework set out in this paper. We find that this method effectively trains a complex model to down-weight the noise, while leaving the signal population relatively unaffected. This improves the sensitivity of the search by \$\textbackslash sim 11\textbackslash\%\$ for signals with masses \${$>$} 300 M\_\textbackslash odot\$. In the future this framework could be used to implement new tests in any of the commonly used matched-filter search algorithms, further improving the sensitivity of our searches.},

Using these parameters the component masses can be predicted, which has implications for the prediction of the likelihood that a merger contains a neutron star. The results are compared to the 'gold standard' of parameter estimation of gravitational waves used by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC), LALInference. Our models predict posterior distributions consistent with that from LALInference while using orders of magnitude less processing time once the models are trained. The median predictions are within the 90\% credible intervals of LALInference for all predicted parameters when tested on real binary black hole events detected during the LVC's first and second observing runs. We argue that deep learning has strong potential for low-latency high-accuracy parameter estimation suitable for real-time GW search pipelines.},

We generate GW signals for a range of stellar models using numerical simulations and apply machine learning to train and classify the signals. We consider an idealized favorable scenario. First, we use rapidly rotating models, which produce stronger GWs than slowly rotating models. Second, we limit ourselves to models with four different masses, which simplifies the selection process. We show that the classification accuracy does not exceed \$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash! 70\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$, signifying that even in this optimistic scenario, the information contained in the bounce and early ring-down GW signal is not sufficient to precisely probe the iron core mass. This suggests that it may be necessary to incorporate additional information such as the GWs from later post-bounce evolution and neutrino observations to accurately measure the iron core mass.},

  abstract = {Gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has presented an unprecedented way to view the universe and study populations of astrophysical objects such as merging compact binaries containing black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). With the latest catalog of observations detected by the Advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network, recent analyses are placing interesting constraints on the population of BHs and NSs in these binaries. In particular, we are learning a great deal about how these binaries are distributed as a function of their masses. Another aspect of GW astronomy that has the potential to provide insights into fundamental physics is the multi-messenger follow up of the potential "kilonova" from binary mergers involving NSs. Observations or non-detections of kilonovae can be used to learn more about the formation of heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis as well as to shed light on the inner mechanisms of such mergers. This dissertation presents two studies that focus on inferring population properties from compact binaries using data-driven methods. The first is using the flexible approach of Gaussian processes to model the mass distribution of compact binaries and the second is developing a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to infer kilonova population properties using non-detections in electromagnetic surveys.},

While conventional analyses parametrize this population with simple phenomenological models, we propose an innovative physics-first approach that compares gravitational-wave data against astrophysical simulations. We combine state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques with hierarchical Bayesian inference and exploit our approach to constrain the properties of repeated black-hole mergers from the gravitational-wave events in the most recent LIGO/Virgo catalog. Deep neural networks allow us to (i) construct a flexible population model that accurately emulates simulations of hierarchical mergers, (ii) estimate selection effects, and (iii) recover the branching ratios of repeated-merger generations. Among our results we find that: the distribution of host-environment escape speeds favors values {$<$}100 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ but is relatively flat; first-generation black holes are born with a maximum mass that is compatible with current estimates from pair-instability supernovae; there is multimodal substructure in both the mass and spin distributions due to repeated mergers; and binaries with a higher-generation component make up at least 15\% of the underlying population. The deep-learning pipeline we present is ready to be used in conjunction with realistic astrophysical population-synthesis predictions.},

  abstract = {We present a convolutional neural network, designed in the auto-encoder configuration that can detect and denoise astrophysical gravitational waves from merging black hole binaries, orders of magnitude faster than the conventional matched-filtering based detection that is currently employed at advanced LIGO (aLIGO). The Neural-Net architecture is such that it learns from the sparse representation of data in the time-frequency domain and constructs a non-linear mapping function that maps this representation into two separate masks for signal and noise, facilitating the separation of the two, from raw data. This approach is the first of its kind to apply machine learning based gravitational wave detection/denoising in the 2D representation of gravitational wave data. We applied our formalism to the first gravitational wave event detected, GW150914, successfully recovering the signal at all three phases of coalescence at both detectors. This method is further tested on the gravitational wave data from the second observing run (\$O2\$) of aLIGO, reproducing all binary black hole mergers detected in \$O2\$ at both the aLIGO detectors. The Neural-Net seems to have uncovered a pattern of 'ringing' after the ringdown phase of the coalescence, which is not a feature that is present in the conventional binary merger templates. This method can also interpolate and extrapolate between modeled templates and explore gravitational waves that are unmodeled and hence not present in the template bank of signals used in the matched-filtering detection pipelines. Faster and efficient detection schemes, such as this method, will be instrumental as ground based detectors reach their design sensitivity, likely to result in several hundreds of potential detections in a few months of observing runs.},

However, in the case of generic black hole binaries with non-aligned spins, if one wants to explore the whole parameter space, matched filtering can become impractical, which sets severe restrictions on the sensitivity and computational efficiency of gravitational-wave searches. Here, we use a novel combination of machine-learning algorithms and arrive at sensitive distances that surpass traditional techniques in a specific setting. Moreover, the computational cost is only a small fraction of the computational cost of matched filtering. The main ingredients are a 54-layer deep residual network (ResNet), a Deep Adaptive Input Normalization (DAIN), a dynamic dataset augmentation, and curriculum learning, based on an empirical relation for the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare the algorithm's sensitivity with two traditional algorithms on a dataset consisting of a large number of injected waveforms of non-aligned binary black hole mergers in real LIGO O3a noise samples. Our machine-learning algorithm can be used in upcoming rapid online searches of gravitational-wave events in a sizeable portion of the astrophysically interesting parameter space.

For coalescences involving neutron stars, the simultaneous observation of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation produced by an event, has broader potential to enhance our understanding of these events, and also to probe the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter. However, electromagnetic follow-up to gravitational wave (GW) events requires rapid real-time detection and classification of GW signals, and conventional detection approaches are computationally prohibitive for the anticipated rate of detection of next-generation GW detectors. In this work, we present the first deep learning based results of classification of GW signals from NSBH mergers in real LIGO data. We show for the first time that a deep neural network can successfully distinguish all three classes of compact binary mergers and separate them from detector noise. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on {$\sim$}500,000 data samples of real LIGO noise with injected BBH, BNS, and NSBH GW signals, and we show that our network has high sensitivity and accuracy. Most importantly, we successfully recover the two confirmed NSBH events to-date (GW191219 and GW200115) and the two confirmed BNS mergers to-date (GW170817 and GW190425), together with {$\sim$}90\% of all BBH candidate events from the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-3. These results are an important step towards low-latency real-time GW detection, enabling multi-messenger astronomy.},

  abstract = {With the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy and the discovery of more compact binary coalescences, data quality improvement techniques are desired to handle the complex and overwhelming noise in gravitational wave (GW) observational data. Though recent studies have shown promising results for data denoising, they are unable to precisely recover both the GW signal amplitude and phase. To address such an issue, we develop a deep neural network centered workflow, WaveFormer, for significant noise suppression and signal recovery on observational data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The WaveFormer has a science-driven architecture design with hierarchical feature extraction across a broad frequency spectrum. As a result, the overall noise and glitch are decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude and the signal recovery error is roughly 1\% and 7\% for the phase and amplitude, respectively. Moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on reported binary black hole events of existing LIGO observing runs and substantial 1386 years inverse false alarm rate improvement on average. Our work highlights the potential of large neural networks for GW data quality improvement and can be extended to the data processing analyses of upcoming observing runs.},

  abstract = {The complex physics involved in atmospheric turbulence makes it very difficult for ground-based astronomy to build accurate scintillation models and develop efficient methodologies to remove this highly structured noise from valuable astronomical observations. We argue that a Deep Learning approach can bring a significant advance to treat this problem because of deep neural networks' inherent ability to abstract non-linear patterns over a broad scale range. We propose an architecture composed of long-short term memory cells and an incremental training strategy inspired by transfer and curriculum learning. We develop a scintillation model and employ an empirical method to generate a vast catalog of atmospheric noise realizations and train the network with representative data. We face two complexity axes: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the degree of structure in the noise. Hence, we train our recurrent network to recognize simulated astrophysical point-like sources embedded in three structured noise levels, with a raw-data SNR ranging from 3 to 0.1. We find that a slow and repetitive increase in complexity is crucial during training to obtain a robust and stable learning rate that can transfer information through different data contexts. We probe our recurrent model with synthetic observational data, designing alongside a calibration methodology for flux measurements. Furthermore, we implement a traditional matched filtering (MF) to compare its performance with our neural network, finding that our final trained network can successfully clean structured noise and significantly enhance the SNR compared to raw data and in a more robust way than traditional MF.},

Crowdsourcing shares the labeling effort among a large number of (possibly non-expert) annotators. Moreover, in many realistic applications, a limited number of expert labels can also be collected to complement the crowdsourcing ones. Such combination of (millions of) crowdsourced and (a few) expert labels is precisely the setting in the GravitySpy project. The goal of GravitySpy is to enhance the detection of gravitational waves, which provide a new way of exploring the early universe in astrophysics (their first detection got the 2017 Physics Nobel prize). In this work, we propose a new probabilistic crowdsourcing model based on sparse Gaussian Processes (GPs) which allows for the integration of expert labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first probabilistic GP-based method that tackles this setting. We demonstrate that the resulting objective function to be optimized is a natural fusion of the crowdsourcing and the standard sparse GP classification objectives. Desirable theoretical properties of the crowdsourcing method, translate in a mathematical sound manner into the new method. The new algorithm is implemented in TensorFlow. A controlled experiment illustrates the properties and behavior of the proposed method. We also show that it performs as theoretically expected in a well-known real-world crowdsourcing dataset. Finally, its application to GravitySpy obtains 92.58\% overall accuracy and 92.27\% test-likelihood, outperforming all previous methods in the literature.},

We produced visualizations of the response of machine learning models when they process advanced LIGO data that contains real gravitational wave signals, noise anomalies, and pure advanced LIGO noise. Our findings shed light on the responses of individual neurons in these machine learning models. Further analysis suggests that different parts of the network appear to specialize in local versus global features, and that this difference appears to be rooted in the branched architecture of the network as well as noise characteristics of the LIGO detectors.

In a previous study, an architecture for classifying transient noise using a time?frequency 2D image (spectrogram) is proposed, which uses unsupervised deep learning combined with variational autoencoder and invariant information clustering. The proposed unsupervised-learning architecture is applied to the Gravity Spy dataset, which consists of Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) transient noises with their associated metadata to discuss the potential for online or offline data analysis. In this study, focused on the Gravity Spy dataset, the training process of unsupervised-learning architecture of the previous study is examined and~reported.},

An exceptional experimental design was needed to measure distance changes less than an atomic nucleus. In the same way, the data analyses to confirm and extract information is a tremendously challenging task. This article shows a computational procedure based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to recognize a black hole-black hole gravitation wave event signal from the LIGO data. With the ANN introduced methodology, it is possible to define a numerical score, like a thermometer. High score values are associated with gravitational wave observation and small values with noise. Building a time series from these scores values, physical information about the astronomical system's damping time, the ring-down time, can be estimated at a first approximation, based on a damped harmonic oscillator modeling. Here, the ring-down time is estimated, at a first approximation, with a direct data measure on the ANN score time series, without using numerical relativity techniques and high computational power.},

  abstract = {We present the results of the first Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Mock Data Challenge (MLGWSC-1). For this challenge, participating groups had to identify gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers of increasing complexity and duration embedded in progressively more realistic noise. The final of the 4 provided datasets contained real noise from the O3a observing run and signals up to a duration of 20 seconds with the inclusion of precession effects and higher order modes. We present the average sensitivity distance and runtime for the 6 entered algorithms derived from 1 month of test data unknown to the participants prior to submission. Of these, 4 are machine learning algorithms. We find that the best machine learning based algorithms are able to achieve up to 95\% of the sensitive distance of matched-filtering based production analyses for simulated Gaussian noise at a false-alarm rate (FAR) of one per month. In contrast, for real noise, the leading machine learning search achieved 70\%. For higher FARs the differences in sensitive distance shrink to the point where select machine learning submissions outperform traditional search algorithms at FARs \$\textbackslash geq 200\$ per month on some datasets. Our results show that current machine learning search algorithms may already be sensitive enough in limited parameter regions to be useful for some production settings. To improve the state-of-the-art, machine learning algorithms need to reduce the false-alarm rates at which they are capable of detecting signals and extend their validity to regions of parameter space where modeled searches are computationally expensive to run. Based on our findings we compile a list of research areas that we believe are the most important to elevate machine learning searches to an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave signal detection.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical mergers in a dense environment are one of the primary formation channels of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) binary system. We expect that the resulting massive binary system will exhibit mass asymmetry. The emitted gravitational-wave (GW) carry significant contribution from higher-order modes and hence complex waveform morphology due to superposition of different modes. Further, IMBH binaries exhibit lower merger frequency and shorter signal duration in the LIGO detector which increases the risk of them being misclassified as short-duration noisy glitches. Deep learning algorithms can be trained to discriminate noisy glitches from short GW transients. We present the \$\textbackslash mathtt\{THAMES\}\$ -- a deep-learning-based end-to-end signal detection algorithm for GW signals from quasi-circular nearly edge-on, mass asymmetric IMBH binaries in advanced GW detectors. Our study shows that it outperforms matched-filter based \$\textbackslash mathtt\{PyCBC\}\$ searches for higher mass asymmetric, nearly edge-on IMBH binaries. The maximum gain in the sensitive volume-time product for mass ratio \$q \textbackslash in (5, 10)\$ is by a factor of 5.24 (2.92) against \$\textbackslash mathtt\{PyCBC-IMBH\}\$ (\$\textbackslash mathtt\{PyCBC-HM\}\$) search at a false alarm rate of 1 in 100 years. Compared to the broad \$\textbackslash mathtt\{PyCBC\}\$ search this factor is \$\textbackslash sim100\$ for the \$q \textbackslash in (10,18)\$. One of the reasons for this leap in volumetric sensitivity is its ability to discriminate between signals with complex waveform morphology and noisy transients, clearly demonstrating the potential of deep learning algorithms in probing into complex signal morphology in the field of gravitational wave astronomy. With the current training set, \$\textbackslash mathtt\{THAMES\}\$ slightly underperforms with respect to \$\textbackslash mathtt\{PyCBC\}\$-based searches targeting intermediate-mass black hole binaries with mass ratio \$q \textbackslash in (5, 10)\$ and detector frame total mass \$M\_T(1+z) \textbackslash in (100,200)\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$.},

The machine-learning (ML) algorithm is trained on a representative set of the noise events and a set of simulated stochastic signals that are not correlated with any known signal model. This training procedure preserves the model-independent nature of the search. We demonstrate that the ML-enhanced cWB pipeline can detect GW signals at a larger distance than the previous model-independent searches, and the sensitivity improvements are achieved across a broad spectrum of simulated signals used in the analysis. At a false-alarm rate of one event per century, the detectable signal amplitudes are reduced up to almost an order of magnitude, most notably for cosmic strings. By testing the pipeline for the detection of compact binaries, we verified that it detects more systems in a wide range of masses from stellar mass to intermediate-mass black-holes, both with circular and elliptical orbits. After excluding previously detected compact binaries, no new gravitational-wave signals are observed for the two-fold Hanford-Livingston and the three-fold Hanford-Livingston-Virgo detector networks. With the improved sensitivity of the all-sky search, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the isotropic emission of gravitational-wave energy from the short-duration burst sources.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves from the coalescences of black hole and neutron stars afford us the unique opportunity to determine the sources' properties, such as their masses and spins, with unprecedented accuracy. To do so, however, theoretical models of the emitted signal that are i) extremely accurate and ii) computationally highly efficient are necessary. The inclusion of more detailed physics such as higher-order multipoles and relativistic spin-induced orbital precession increases the complexity and hence also computational cost of waveform models, which presents a severe bottleneck to the parameter inference problem. A popular method to generate waveforms more efficiently is to build a fast surrogate model of a slower one. In this paper, we show that traditional surrogate modelling methods combined with artificial neural networks can be used to build a computationally highly efficient while still accurate emulation of multipolar time-domain waveform models of precessing binary black holes. We apply this method to the state-of-the-art waveform model SEOBNRv4PHM and find significant computational improvements: On a traditional CPU, the typical generation of a single waveform using our neural network surrogate SEOBNN\_v4PHM\_4dq2 takes 18ms for a binary black hole with a total mass of \$44 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ when generated from 20Hz. In comparison to SEOBNRv4PHM itself, this amounts to an improvement in computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. Utilising additional GPU acceleration, we find that this speed-up can be increased further with the generation of batches of waveforms simultaneously. Even without additional GPU acceleration, this dramatic decrease in waveform generation cost can reduce the inference timescale from weeks to hours.},

  abstract = {Current searches for gravitational waves from black hole binaries with LIGO and Virgo observatories are limited to using the analytical models computed for the systems with spins of the black holes aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary. The observation of black hole binaries with precessing spins (spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum) could provide unique astrophysical insights into the formation of these sources; thus, it is crucial to design a search scheme to detect compact binaries with precession spins. It has been shown that the detection of compact binaries carrying precessing spins is not achievable with aligned-spins template waveforms. Efforts have been made to construct the template banks to detect the precessing binaries using the matched filtering based detection pipelines. However, in the absence of robust methods and huge computational requirements, the precessing searches, more or less, still remain a challenge. This work introduces a detection scheme for the binary black holes to classify them into aligned and precessing systems using a convolution neural network (\textbackslash CNN). We treat the detection of the \$\textbackslash GW\$ signals from \$\textbackslash BBH\$ systems as a classification problem. Our architecture first classifies data as \$\textbackslash GW\$ signals originated from binary black holes (\$\textbackslash BBH\$) or noise and then it further classifies the detected \$\textbackslash BBH\$ systems as precessing or non-precessing (aligned/anti-aligned) systems. Our classifier with an accuracy of \$\textbackslash approx\$ 99\textbackslash\% classifies between noise and the signal and with an accuracy of \$\textbackslash approx\$ 91\textbackslash\% it classifies the detected signals into aligned and precessing signals. We have also extended our analysis for a multi-detector framework and tested the performance of our designed architecture on \$\textbackslash O1\$, \$\textbackslash O2\$ and \$\textbackslash O3\$ data to identify the detected \$\textbackslash BBH\$ events as aligned and precessing events.},

These signals contain information about the nature of the remnant and the high-density and out-of-equilibrium physics of the postmerger processes, which would complement any electromagnetic signal. However, the construction of binary neutron star postmerger waveforms is much more complicated than for binary black holes: (i) there are theoretical uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state and other aspects of the high-density physics, (ii) numerical simulations are expensive and available ones only cover a small fraction of the parameter space with limited numerical accuracy, and (iii) it is unclear how to parametrize the theoretical uncertainties and interpolate across parameter space. In this work, we describe the use of a machine-learning method called a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to construct postmerger models for hyper/massive neutron star remnant signals based on numerical-relativity simulations. The CVAE provides a probabilistic model, which encodes uncertainties in the training data within a set of latent parameters. We estimate that training such a model will ultimately require \$\textbackslash sim 10\^4\$ waveforms. However, using synthetic training waveforms as a proof-of-principle, we show that the CVAE can be used as an accurate generative model and that it encodes the equation of state in a useful latent representation.},

By conditioning also on the noise power spectral density (PSD) they can even account for changing detector characteristics. However, training such networks requires knowing in advance the distribution of PSDs expected to be observed, and therefore can only take place once all data to be analyzed have been gathered. Here, we develop a probabilistic model to forecast future PSDs, greatly increasing the temporal scope of DINGO networks. Using PSDs from the second LIGO-Virgo observing run (O2) \$\textbackslash unicode\{x2013\}\$ plus just a single PSD from the beginning of the third (O3) \$\textbackslash unicode\{x2013\}\$ we show that we can train a DINGO network to perform accurate inference throughout O3 (on 37 real events).

This volume of data is too much for visual inspection by volunteers alone to be feasible and gravitational lenses will only appear in a small fraction of these data which could cause a large amount of false positives. Machine learning is the obvious alternative but the algorithms' internal workings are not obviously interpretable, so their selection functions are opaque and it is not clear whether they would select against important rare populations. We design, build, and train several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify strong gravitational lenses using VIS, Y, J, and H bands of simulated data, with F1 scores between 0.83 and 0.91 on 100,000 test set images. We demonstrate for the first time that such CNNs do not select against compound lenses, obtaining recall scores as high as 76\textbackslash\% for compound arcs and 52\textbackslash\% for double rings. We verify this performance using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data of all known compound lens systems. Finally, we explore for the first time the interpretability of these CNNs using Deep Dream, Guided Grad-CAM, and by exploring the kernels of the convolutional layers, to illuminate why CNNs succeed in compound lens selection.},

Our network has learned to classify the input strain data into four categories: (1) only Gaussian noise, (2) an astrophysical signal injected into Gaussian noise, (3) a line embedded in Gaussian noise, and (4) an astrophysical signal contaminated by both Gaussian noise and line noise. In our algorithm, different frequencies are treated independently; therefore, our network is robust against sets of evenly-spaced lines, i.e., combs, and we only need to consider perfectly sinusoidal line in this work. We find that our neural network can distinguish between astrophysical signals and lines with high accuracy. In a frequency band without line noise, the sensitivity depth of our network is about \$\textbackslash mathcal\{D\}\^\{95\textbackslash\%\} \textbackslash simeq 43.9\$ with a false alarm probability of \$\textbackslash sim 0.5\textbackslash\%\$, while in the presence of line noise, we can maintain a false alarm probability of \$\textbackslash sim 10\textbackslash\%\$ and achieve \$\textbackslash mathcal\{D\}\^\textbackslash mathrm\{95\textbackslash\%\} \textbackslash simeq 3.62\$ when the line noise amplitude is \$h\_0\^\textbackslash mathrm\{line\}/\textbackslash sqrt\{S\_\textbackslash mathrm\{n\}(f\_k)\} = 1.0\$.

Our results show that our method is more efficient by one or two orders of magnitude than standard searches. Although our neural network takes about \$O(10\^8)\$ sec to employ using our current facilities (a single GPU of GTX1080Ti), we expect that it can be reduced to an acceptable level by utilizing a larger number of improved GPUs.},

For the detection problem, we compare three neural networks with different structures: a shallower convolutional neural network (CNN), a deeper CNN, and a residual network. We show that the residual network can achieve comparable sensitivity as the conventional non-Gaussian statistic for signals with the astrophysical duty cycle of \$\textbackslash log\_\{10\}\textbackslash xi \textbackslash in [-3,-1]\$. Furthermore, we apply deep learning for parameter estimation with two approaches, in which the neural network (1) directly provides the duty cycle and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and (2) classifies the data into four classes depending on the duty cycle value.

Various approaches have been proposed for improving the efficiency of the detection scheme, with hierarchical matched filtering being an important strategy. Meanwhile, deep learning methods have recently demonstrated both consistency with matched filtering methods and remarkable statistical performance. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Detection Network (HDN), a novel approach to efficient detection that combines ideas from hierarchical matching and deep learning. The network is trained using a novel loss function, which encodes simultaneously the goals of statistical accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the source of complexity reduction of the proposed model, and describe a general recipe for initialization with each layer specializing in different regions. We demonstrate the performance of HDN with experiments using open LIGO data and synthetic injections, and observe with two-layer models a \$79\textbackslash\%\$ efficiency gain compared with matched filtering at an equal error rate of \$0.2\textbackslash\%\$. Furthermore, we show how training a three-layer HDN initialized using two-layer model can further boost both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the power of multiple simple layers in efficient detection.},

  abstract = {Gravitational wave science is a pioneering field with rapidly evolving data analysis methodology currently assimilating and inventing deep learning techniques. The bulk of the sophisticated flagship searches of the field rely on the time-tested matched filtering principle within their core. In this paper, we make a key observation on the relationship between the emerging deep learning and the traditional techniques: matched filtering is formally equivalent to a particular neural network. This means that a neural network can be constructed analytically to exactly implement matched filtering, and can be further trained on data or boosted with additional complexity for improved performance. Moreover, we show that the proposed neural network architecture can outperform matched filtering, both with or without knowledge of a prior on the parameter distribution. When a prior is given, the proposed neural network can approach the statistically optimal performance. We also propose and investigate two different neural network architectures MNet-Shallow and MNet-Deep, both of which implement matched filtering at initialization and can be trained on data. MNet-Shallow has simpler structure, while MNet-Deep is more flexible and can deal with a wider range of distributions. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments using real LIGO data and synthetic injections, where our proposed methods significantly outperform matched filtering at false positive rates above \$5\textbackslash times 10\^\{-3\}\textbackslash\%\$. The fundamental equivalence between matched filtering and neural networks allows us to define a "complexity standard candle" to characterize the relative complexity of the different approaches to gravitational wave signal searches in a common framework. Finally, our results suggest new perspectives on the role of deep learning in gravitational wave detection.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been applied to the detection of gravitational wave signals in the past few years. Most existing methods focus on the data obtained by a single detector. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gravitational wave signals in a single detector is pretty low, making it hard for deep neural networks to learn effective features. Therefore, how to use the observation signals obtained by multiple detectors in deep learning methods is a serious issue. We simulate binary neutron star signals from multiple detectors, including the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. We calculate coherent SNR of multiple detectors using a fully coherent all-sky search method and obtain the coherent SNR data required for our proposed deep learning method. Inspired by the principle of attention network Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and the soft thresholding shrinkage function, we propose a novel Squeeze-and-Excitation Shrinkage (SES) module to better extract effective features. Then we use this module to establish a gravitational wave squeeze-and-excitation shrinkage network (GW-SESNet) detection model. We train and validate the performance of our model on the coherent SNR data set. Our model obtains satisfactory classification accuracy and can excellently complete the task of gravitational wave detection.},

In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the classification performance by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As substantial efforts and expertise are required to annotate spectrograms, the number of training examples is very limited. However, it is well known that deep networks can perform well only when the sample size of the training set is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the imbalanced sample sizes in different classes can also hamper the performance. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a GAN-based data augmentation framework. While standard data augmentation methods for conventional images cannot be applied on spectrograms, we found that a variant of GANs, ProGAN, is capable of generating high-resolution spectrograms which are consistent with the quality of the high-resolution original images and provide a desirable diversity. We have validated our framework by classifying glitches in the Gravity Spy dataset with the GAN-generated spectrograms for training. We show that the proposed method can provide an alternative to transfer learning for the classification of spectrograms using deep networks, i.e. using a high-resolution GAN for data augmentation instead. Furthermore, fluctuations in classification performance with small sample sizes for training and evaluation can be greatly reduced. Using the trained network in our framework, we have also examined the spectrograms with label anomalies in Gravity Spy.},

One promising way to tackle this challenge is to perform nonlinear noise mitigation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which we examine in detail in this study. In many cases, the noise coupling is bilinear and can be viewed as a few fast channels' outputs modulated by some slow channels. We show that we can utilize this knowledge of the physical system and adopt an explicit ``slow\texttimes fast'' structure in the design of the CNN to enhance its performance of noise subtraction. We then examine the requirements in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the target channel (i.e., the main GW readout) and in the auxiliary sensors in order to reduce the noise by at least a factor of a few. In the case of limited SNR in the target channel, we further demonstrate that the CNN can still reach a good performance if we use curriculum learning techniques, which in reality can be achieved by combining data from quiet times and those from periods with active noise injections.},

We demonstrate the performance with simulated EMRI signals buried in Gaussian noise. We show that over a wide range of physical parameters, the network is effective for EMRI systems with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 50, and the performance is most strongly related to the signal-to-noise ratio. The method also shows good generalization ability towards different waveform models.

  abstract = {The recent detection of gravitational waves is a remarkable milestone in the history of astrophysics. With the further development of gravitational wave detection technology, traditional filter-matching methods no longer meet the needs of signal recognition. Thus, it is imperative that we develop new methods. In this study, we apply a gravitational wave signal recognition model based on Fourier transformation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The gravitational wave time-domain signal is transformed into a 2D frequency-domain signal graph for feature recognition using a CNN model. Experimental results reveal that the frequency-domain signal graph provides a better feature description of the gravitational wave signal than that provided by the time-domain signal. Our method takes advantage of the CNN\&\#x2019;s convolution computation to improve the accuracy of signal recognition. The impact of the training set size and image filtering on the performance of the developed model is also evaluated. Additionally, the Resnet101 model, developed on the Baidu EasyDL platform, is adopted as a comparative model. Our average recognition accuracy performs approximately 4\&\#x0025; better than the Resnet101 model. Based on the excellent performance of convolutional neural network in the field of image recognition, this paper studies the characteristics of gravitational wave signals and obtains a more appropriate recognition model after training and tuning, in order to achieve the purpose of automatic recognition of whether the signal data contain real gravitational wave signals.},

Here, we develop a high-accuracy GW signal detection and extraction method for all space-based GW sources. As a proof of concept, we show that a science-driven and uniform multi-stage deep neural network can identify synthetic signals that are submerged in Gaussian noise. Our method has more than 99\% accuracy for signal detection of various sources while obtaining at least 95\% similarity compared with target signals.

Though recent studies have shown promising results for data denoising, they are unable to precisely recover both the GW signal amplitude and phase. To address such an issue, we develop a deep neural network centered workflow, WaveFormer, for significant noise suppression and signal recovery on observational data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The WaveFormer has a science-driven architecture design with hierarchical feature extraction across a broad frequency spectrum. As a result, the overall noise and glitch are decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude and the signal recovery error is roughly 1\% and 7\% for the phase and amplitude, respectively. Moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on reported binary black hole events of existing LIGO observing runs and substantial 1386 years inverse false alarm rate improvement on average. Our work highlights the potential of large neural networks for GW data quality improvement and can be extended to the data processing analyses of upcoming observing runs.},

Given the higher expected event rate in the next observing run (O4), LIGO-Virgo GW event candidate validation will require increased levels of automation. Gravity Spy, a machine learning tool that successfully classified common types of LIGO and Virgo glitches in previous observing runs, has the potential to be restructured as a signal-vs-glitch classifier to accurately distinguish between glitches and GW signals. A signal-vs-glitch classifier used for automation must be robust and compatible with a broad array of background noise, new sources of glitches, and the likely occurrence of overlapping glitches and GWs.

  abstract = {Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.},

  abstract = {Interferometric gravitational-wave observatories have opened a new era in astronomy. The rich data produced by an international network enables detailed analysis of the curved space-time around black holes. With nearly one hundred signals observed so far and thousands expected in the next decade, their population properties enable insights into stellar evolution and the expansion of our Universe. However, the detectors are afflicted by transient noise artefacts known as `glitches' which contaminate the signals and bias inferences. Of the 90 signals detected to date, 18 were contaminated by glitches. This feasibility study explores a new approach to transient gravitational-wave data analysis using Gaussian processes, which model the underlying physics of the glitch-generating mechanism rather than the explicit realisation of the glitch itself. We demonstrate that if the Gaussian process kernel function can adequately model the glitch morphology, we can recover the parameters of simulated signals. Moreover, we find that the Gaussian processes kernels used in this work are well-suited to modelling long-duration glitches which are most challenging for existing glitch-mitigation approaches. Finally, we show how the time-domain nature of our approach enables a new class of time-domain tests of General Relativity, performing a re-analysis of the inspiral-merger-ringdown test on the first observed binary black hole merger. Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of the Gaussian processes as an alternative to the traditional framework but does not yet establish them as a replacement. Therefore, we conclude with an outlook on the steps needed to realise the full potential of the Gaussian process approach.},

  abstract = {The current and upcoming generations of gravitational wave experiments represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context, however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational wave community. For example, it will be crucial to develop tools and strategies to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2\textbackslash\% of the waveform evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these current and future gravitational wave data analysis problems.},

  abstract = {The gravitational-wave (GW) detector data are affected by short-lived instrumental or terrestrial transients, called glitches, which can simulate GW signals. Mitigation of glitches is particularly difficult for algorithms which target generic sources of short-duration GW transients (GWT), and do not rely on GW waveform models to distinguish astrophysical signals from noise, such as Coherent WaveBurst (cWB). This work is part of the long-term effort to mitigate transient noises in cWB, which led to the introduction of specific estimators, and a machine-learning based signal-noise classification algorithm. Here, we propose an autoencoder neural network, integrated into cWB, that learns transient noises morphologies from GW time-series. We test its performance on the glitch family known as blip. The resulting sensitivity to generic GWT and binary black hole mergers significantly improves when tested on LIGO detectors data from the last observation period (O3b). At false alarm rate of one event per 50 years the sensitivity volume increases up to 30\% for signal morphologies similar to blip glitches. In perspective, this tool can adapt to classify different transient noise classes that may affect future observing runs, enhancing GWT searches.},

  abstract = {Glitches are non-Gaussian transient waves that mimic gravitational-wave signals. As the glitches are abundant in the detector, the data quality is significantly impacted. Thus, it is crucial to identify glitch types to eliminate from the data and unveil the true astrophysical events. In this work, we explore the performance of machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, extreme gradient boost, and support vector machines for glitch classification using features extracted by employing the transfer learning method on Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 deep learning models. The transfer learning approach is carried out using two different methods. The first strategy relies on fine-tuning a pre-trained model using our dataset, whereas the second approach employs pre-trained models as feature extractor modules. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in training time with the transfer learning method followed by machine learning algorithms compared to the fine-tuning approach. With the approach having the lowest training time of 37.6~s, we were able to acquire a classification accuracy of 93.98\%. Compared to the model trained with fine-tuning, transfer learning provides 24 and 31 times faster training time in ResNet-50 and Inception-v3, respectively, which could be enormously advantageous for the glitch classification process in the LIGO experiment.},

  abstract = {The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parameteric models; such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks, and then measure the parameters governing these "building block" features. Although this approach has yielded great progress in initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed leave it often unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown autoregressive process over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly-peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by a rise in the merger rate beyond redshift \$z\textbackslash approx 0.5\$. Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but non-zero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also unlikely to be truly isotropic.},

Building on recent advances in generative modeling, we here present flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE), a technique for SBI using continuous normalizing flows. Like diffusion models, and in contrast to discrete flows, flow matching allows for unconstrained architectures, providing enhanced flexibility for complex data modalities. Flow matching, therefore, enables exact density evaluation, fast training, and seamless scalability to large architectures--making it ideal for SBI. We show that FMPE achieves competitive performance on an established SBI benchmark, and then demonstrate its improved scalability on a challenging scientific problem: for gravitational-wave inference, FMPE outperforms methods based on comparable discrete flows, reducing training time by 30\% with substantially improved accuracy. Our work underscores the potential of FMPE to enhance performance in challenging inference scenarios, thereby paving the way for more advanced applications to scientific problems.},

Second, we also explore a self-supervised approach, pre-training models with automatically generated pseudo-labels. Our findings are very close to existing results for the same dataset, reaching values for the F1 score of 97.18\% (94.15\%) for the best supervised (self-supervised) model. We further test the models using actual gravitational-wave signals from LIGO-Virgo's O3 run. Although trained using data from previous runs (O1 and O2), the models show good performance, in particular when using transfer learning. We find that transfer learning improves the scores without the need for any training on real signals apart from the less than 50 chirp examples from hardware injections present in the Gravity Spy dataset. This motivates the use of transfer learning not only for glitch classification but also for signal classification.},

  abstract = {Gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens may resolve the Hubble tension, provided that standard siren inference of \$H\_0\$ is free from systematic biases. However, standard sirens from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers suffer from two sources of systematic bias, one arising from the anisotropy of GW emission, and the other from the anisotropy of electromagnetic (EM) emission from the kilonova. For an observed sample of BNS mergers, the traditional Bayesian approach to debiasing involves the direct computation of the detection likelihood. This is infeasible for large samples of detected BNS merger due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space governing merger detection. In this study, we bypass this computation by fitting the Hubble constant to forward simulations of the observed GW and EM data under a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework using marginal neural ratio estimation. A key innovation of our method is the inclusion of BNS mergers which were only detected in GW, which allows for estimation of the bias introduced by EM anisotropy. Our method corrects for \$\textbackslash sim\$90\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the bias in the inferred value of \$H\_0\$ when telescope follow-up observations of BNS mergers have extensive tiling of the merger localization region, using known telescope sensitivities and assuming a model of kilonova emission. Our SBI-based method thus enables a debiased inference of the Hubble constant of BNS mergers, including both mergers with detected EM counterparts and those without.},

At the 95\textbackslash\% confidence level, the ANN estimators confirm that there is no black hole solution in higher dimensions and that gravitational collapse does not occur. Results provide some doubts about the universality of the Choptuik phenomena. Therefore, we conclude that the fastest-growing mode of the perturbations that determine the critical exponent does not exist for the parabolic class in higher dimensions.},

We compared the performance of 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on single and multiple detector data. For the first time, we tested multi-label classification also with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. \$Methods.\$ We applied a search and classification procedure for CCSNe signals, using an event trigger generator, the Wavelet Detection Filter (WDF), coupled with ML. We used time series and time-frequency representations of the data as inputs to the ML models. To compute classification accuracies, we simultaneously injected, at detectable distance of 1\textbackslash,kpc, CCSN waveforms, obtained from recent hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven core-collapse, onto interferometer noise from the O2 LIGO and Virgo science run. \$Results.\$ We compared the performance of the three models on single detector data. We then merged the output of the models for single detector classification of noise and astrophysical transients, obtaining overall accuracies for LIGO (\$\textbackslash sim99\textbackslash\%\$) and (\$\textbackslash sim80\textbackslash\%\$) for Virgo. We extended our analysis to the multi-detector case using triggers coincident among the three ITFs and achieved an accuracy of \$\textbackslash sim98\textbackslash\%\$.},

The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observation run, about \$80\textbackslash\%\$ GW events could be identified and GW190814 is inferred to be a BBH merger event. Moreover, since the U-Net algorithm has advantages in image processing, the time-frequency domain signals obtained through U-Net can preliminarily determine the masses of GW sources, which could help provide the mass priors for future parameter inferences. We conclude that the U-Net algorithm could rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and provide great help for future parameter inferences.},

This challenge has motivated the exploration of alternative search methods, such as deep neural networks (DNNs). Previous attempts to apply convolutional image-classification DNN architectures to all-sky and directed CW searches showed promise for short, one-day search durations, but proved ineffective for longer durations of around ten days. In this paper, we offer a hypothesis for this limitation and propose new design principles to overcome it. As a proof of concept, we show that our novel convolutional DNN architecture attains matched-filtering sensitivity for a targeted search (i.e., single sky-position and frequency) in Gaussian data from two detectors spanning ten days. We illustrate this performance for two different sky positions and five frequencies in the \$20 - 1000 \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\$ range, spanning the spectrum from an ``easy'' to the ``hardest'' case. The corresponding sensitivity depths fall in the range of \$82 - 86 / \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\}\$. The same DNN architecture is trained for each case, taking between \$4 - 32\$ hours to reach matched-filtering sensitivity. The detection probability of the trained DNNs as a function of signal amplitude varies consistently with that of matched filtering. Furthermore, the DNN statistic distributions can be approximately mapped to those of the \$\textbackslash mathcal\{F\}\$-statistic under a simple monotonic function.},

We here apply it to search for long-duration transient gravitational waves triggered by pulsar glitches, which could yield physical insight into the mostly unknown depths of the pulsar. Current methods to search for such signals rely on matched filtering and a brute-force grid search over possible signal durations, which is sensitive but can become very computationally expensive. We develop a method to search for post-glitch signals on combining matched filtering with convolutional neural networks, which reaches similar sensitivities to the standard method at false-alarm probabilities relevant for practical searches, while being significantly faster. We specialize to the Vela glitch during the LIGO-Virgo O2 run, and set upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude from the data of the two LIGO detectors for both constant-amplitude and exponentially decaying signals.},

Our analysis reveals that GPs are quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific mission under study.

  abstract = {Current templated searches for gravitational waves (GWs) emanated from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) assume that the binaries have circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. However, certain formation channels predict that in future observing runs (O4 and beyond), a fraction of detectable binaries could enter the sensitivity band with a measurable eccentricity \$e\$. Constraining \$e\$ for each GW event with Bayesian parameter estimation methods is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This motivates the need for a machine learning based identification and classification scheme, which could weed out the majority of GW events as non-eccentric and drastically reduce the set of candidate eccentric GWs. As a proof of principle, we train a separable-convolutional neural network (SCNN) with spectrograms of synthetic GWs added to Gaussian noise characterized by O4 representative PSDs. We use the trained network to (i) segregate candidates as either eccentric or non-eccentric (henceforth called the detection problem) and (ii) classify the events as non-eccentric \$(e = 0)\$, moderately eccentric \$(e \textbackslash in (0, 0.2])\$, and highly eccentric \$(e \textbackslash in (0.2, 0.5])\$. On the detection problem, our best performing network detects eccentricity with \$0.986\$ accuracy and true and false positive rates of \$0.984\$ and \$1.6\textbackslash times 10\^\{-3\}\$, respectively. On the classification problem, the best performing network classifies signals with \$0.962\$ accuracy.

In light of the new features found in the mass spectrum of binary black holes and the uncertainty regarding binary formation models, non-parametric population inference has become increasingly popular. In this work, we develop a data-driven clustering framework that can identify features in the component mass distribution of compact binaries simultaneously with those in the corresponding redshift distribution, from gravitational wave data in the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, while making very few assumptions on the functional form of these distributions. Our generalized model is capable of inferring correlations among various population properties such as the redshift evolution of the shape of the mass distribution itself, in contrast to most existing non-parametric inference schemes. We test our model on simulated data and demonstrate the accuracy with which it can re-construct the underlying distributions of component masses and redshifts. We also re-analyze public LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from events in GWTC-3 using our model and compare our results with those from some alternative parametric and non-parametric population inference approaches. Finally, we investigate the potential presence of correlations between mass and redshift in the population of binary black holes in GWTC-3 (those observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network in their first 3 observing runs), without making any assumptions about the specific nature of these correlations.},

Second-generation ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo have been extremely successful in detecting gravitational wave signals from coalescence of black holes and/or neutron stars. However, in order to reach the required sensitivities, the background noise must be investigated and removed. In particular, transient noise events called "glitches" can affect data quality and mimic real astrophysical signals, and it is therefore of paramount importance to characterize them and find their origin, a task that will support the activities of detector characterization of Virgo and other interferometers. Machine learning is one of the most promising approaches to characterize and remove noise glitches in real time, thus improving the sensitivity of interferometers. A key input to the preparation of a training dataset for these machine learning algorithms can originate from citizen science initiatives, where volunteers contribute to classify and analyze signals collected by detectors. We will present GWitchHunters, a new citizen science project focused on the study of gravitational wave noise, that has been developed within the REINFORCE project (a "Science With And For Society" project funded under the EU's H2020 program). We will present the project, its development and the key tasks that citizens are participating in, as well as its impact on the study of noise in the Advanced Virgo detector.},

Furthermore, it allows for samples to be added in any order, independently of a likelihood constraint, and for the evidence to be updated with batches of samples. We call the modified algorithm i-nessai. We first validate i-nessai using analytic likelihoods with known Bayesian evidences and show that the evidence estimates are unbiased in up to 32 dimensions. We compare i-nessai to standard nessai for the analytic likelihoods and the Rosenbrock likelihood, the results show that i-nessai is consistent with nessai whilst producing more precise evidence estimates. We then test i-nessai on 64 simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole coalescence and show that it produces unbiased estimates of the parameters. We compare our results to those obtained using standard nessai and dynesty and find that i-nessai requires 2.68 and 13.3 times fewer likelihood evaluations to converge, respectively. We also test i-nessai of an 80-second simulated binary neutron star signal using a Reduced-Order-Quadrature (ROQ) basis and find that, on average, it converges in 24 minutes, whilst only requiring 1.01 \texttimes{} 106 likelihood evaluations compared to 1.42 \texttimes{} 106 for nessai and 4.30 \texttimes{} 107 for dynesty.

  abstract = {We present results on the mass, spin, and redshift distributions with phenomenological population models using the 10 binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected in the first and second observing runs completed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We constrain properties of the BBH mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive BH in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1\% of BHs more massive than 45 and a power-law index of {$\alpha~$}=~~(90\% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of BHs with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modeling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or increasing with redshift with 93\% probability. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R~=~~Gpc-3 yr-1~(90\% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of BHs via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of BHs across cosmic time.},

  abstract = {We present the results from three gravitational-wave searches for coalescing compact binaries with component masses above 1\$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ during the first and second observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network. During the first observing run (O1), from September \$12\^\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\$, 2015 to January \$19\^\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\$, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November \$30\^\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\$, 2016 to August \$25\^\textbackslash mathrm\{th\}\$, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818 and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between \$18.6\_\{-0.7\}\^\{+3.2\}\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, and \$84.4\_\{-11.1\}\^\{+15.8\} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, and range in distance between \$320\_\{-110\}\^\{+120\}\$ Mpc and \$2840\_\{-1360\}\^\{+1400\}\$ Mpc. No neutron star - black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90\% confidence intervals of \$110\textbackslash, -\textbackslash, 3840\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{y\}\^\{-1\}\$ for binary neutron stars and \$9.7\textbackslash, -\textbackslash, 101\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{y\}\^\{-1\}\$ for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions, and determine a neutron star - black hole merger rate 90\% upper limit of \$610\$ \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{y\}\^\{-1\}\$.},

  abstract = {Compact object mergers which produce both detectable gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) emission can provide valuable insights into the neutron star equation of state, the tension in the Hubble constant, and the origin of the r-process elements. However, EM follow-up of gravitational wave sources is complicated by false-positive detections, and the transient nature of the associated EM emission. GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model that attempts facilitate EM follow-up by providing real-time predictions of the source of a gravitational wave detection. The model uses information from Open Public Alerts (OPAs) released by LIGO\textendash Virgo within minutes of a gravitational wave detection. GWSkyNet was introduced in Cabero et al. as a binary classifier and uses the OPA skymaps to classify sources as either astrophysical or as glitches. In this paper, we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi, an extension of GWSkyNet which further distinguishes sources as binary black hole mergers, mergers involving a neutron star, or non-astrophysical glitches. GWSkyNet-Multi is a sequence of three one-versus-all classifiers trained using a class-balanced and physically motivated source mass distribution. Training on this data set, we obtain test set accuracies of 93.7\% for binary black hole-versus-all, 94.4\% for neutron star-versus-all, and 95.1\% for glitch-versus-all. We obtain an overall accuracy of 93.4\% using a hierarchical classification scheme. Furthermore, we correctly identify 36 of the 40 gravitational wave detections from the first half of LIGO\textendash Virgo's third observing run (O3a) and present predictions for O3b sources. As gravitational wave detections increase in number and frequency, GWSkyNet-Multi will be a powerful tool for prioritizing successful EM follow-up.},

Deep-learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate weakly interacting massive particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids. This is crucial in future efforts to identify the true nature of dark matter. We implement, for the first time, a classification approach to identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure. Utilizing convolutional neural networks trained on sets of simulated images, we demonstrate the feasibility of deep neural networks to reliably distinguish among different types of dark matter substructure. With thousands of strong lensing images anticipated with the coming launch of Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we expect that supervised and unsupervised deep-learning models will play a crucial role in determining the nature of dark matter.},

  abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser-interferometric detectors requires sensitivity to changes in distance much smaller than the diameter of atomic nuclei. Though sophisticated machinery and techniques have been developed over the past few decades to isolate such instruments from non-astrophysical noise, the detectors are still susceptible to instrumental and environmental noise transients known as ``glitches,'' which hinder searches for transient gravitational waves. The Gravity Spy project is an effort to comprehensively classify the glitches that afflict gravitational wave detectors into morphological families by combining the strengths of machine learning algorithms and citizen scientists. This paper presents the initial Gravity Spy dataset used for citizen scientist and machine learning classification \textendash{} a static, accessible, documented dataset for testing machine learning supervised classification. Previous versions of this dataset used in [8, 53] did not include all current classes and also for some of the classes, some samples were pruned and added. This set consists of time\textendash frequency images of LIGO glitches and their associated metadata. These glitches are organized by time\textendash frequency morphology into 22 classes for which descriptions and representative images are presented. Results from the application of state-of-the-art supervised classification methods to this dataset are presented in order to provide baselines for future glitch classification work. Standard splitting for training, validation, and testing sets are also presented to facilitate the comparison between different machine learning methods. The baseline methods are selected from both traditional and more recent deep learning approaches. An ensemble framework is developed that demonstrates that combining various classifiers can yield a more accurate model for classification. The ensemble classifier, trained with the standard training set, achieves 98.21\% accuracy on the standard test set.},

  abstract = {With GW170817, gravitational waves have shown themselves to be very useful for multi-messenger astronomy. Combining the information from multiple channels such as gravitational waves, gamma-rays, neutrinos, etc. can lead to great physics. Contrarily to the electromagnetic telescopes, a gravitational wave interferometer surveys the entire sky. They do not have to focus on a small portion of the celestial sphere as do standard telescopes. It is also known that for binary neutron stars, the electromagnetic counterpart is produced during the last phase of the merger, whereas the gravitational wave signal can be detected several minutes before these last stages. If one is able to detect this signal before the merger and infer the sky location, gravitational wave astronomy can then send an alert and produce a sky map indicating where the astronomer can point their telescopes to see an electromagnetic counterpart. The standard technique to detect these compact binary coalescences is matched filtering. The principle is to compute a template bank of pre-computed waveforms and match them with the data strain coming from the LIGO and Virgo interferometers. This thesis starts by illustrating a matched filter search with a project to detect long signals coming from sub-solar coalescence. Recently, some matched filtering pipelines have started to adapt their method to search for gravitational waves with only the early stage of the signal. Other methods are beginning to be developed for this type of research. This thesis presents new methods, based on machine learning, to detect the early phase of a binary neutron star merger. We have developed multiple convolutional neural networks looking directly at the strain data of the detector to detect binary neutron stars before the merger. The last step to produce an early warning for the astronomer is to create a sky map indicating the location of the event. We therefore shortly discuss how to accomplish this through a machine learning method for the whole signal, and also mention how it can be adapted to the early part of the signal.},

The particular study of this article is within the context of the gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two spinless black holes in initial quasi-circular orbit. We find, for example, that approaches such as Gaussian process regression with radial bases as kernels, an approach which is generalizable to multiple dimensions with low computational evaluation cost, do provide a sufficiently accurate solution. The results here presented suggest that AutoML might provide a framework for regression in the field of surrogates for gravitational waveforms. Our study is within the context of surrogates of numerical relativity simulations based on reduced basis and the empirical interpolation method, where we find that for the particular case analyzed AutoML can produce surrogates which are essentially indistinguishable from the NR simulations themselves.},

  abstract = {The field of gravitational wave astronomy is still in its early stages, with published detections of compact binary coalescences numbering 14 and the most recent observing run (O3) providing 50 more candidates. Another possible source of gravitational waves is rapidly rotating neutron stars which can emit gravitational waves if they have some asymmetry around their rotation axis. These are predicted to emit long duration quasi-sinusoidal signals known as continuous gravitational waves. All-sky and wide parameter space searches for continuous gravitational waves are generally template-matching schemes which test a bank of signal waveforms against data from a gravitational wave detector. Often these searches are highly-tuned to specific signal types and are computationally expensive. We have developed a search method (entitled SOAP) based on the Viterbi algorithm which is model-agnostic and has a computational cost several orders of magnitude lower than template methods and with a comparable sensitivity. In particular, this method can search for signals which have an unknown frequency evolution. We test the algorithm on three simulated and real data sets: gapless Gaussian noise, Gaussian noise with gaps and real data from the final run of initial LIGO (S6). We show that at 95\% efficiency, with a 1\% false alarm rate, the algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 60, 72 and 74 in the optimal coherent signal to noise ratio in each of these datasets. We discuss the use of this algorithm for detecting a wide range of quasi-monochromatic gravitational wave signals and instrumental artefacts, and demonstrate that it can also identify shorter duration signals such as compact binary coalescences. Many continuous gravitational wave searches are affected by instrumental lines as the long duration narrowband nature of a line can appear to be very similar to a real continuous gravitational wave signal. This has led to the development of techniques to try and limit the effect of instrumental lines, which mostly involve developing a statistic to penalise signals that appear in only a single detector. Whilst these statistics limit the effect of instrumental lines, in the SOAP search described above, many lines still contaminate the statistics and have to be manually removed by investigating other search outputs. We have developed a method using convolutional neural networks to reduce the impact of instrumental artefacts on the SOAP search described above. This has the ability to identify features in each of the detectors spectrograms such that a frequency band can be classified into a signal or noise class. This limits the amount of manual investigation of frequency bands and allowed the SOAP search to be fully automated without a reduction in the sensitivity. Once a continuous gravitational wave is detected, we would want to extract some parameters associated with the source to help understand more about its structure and evolution. We describe a Bayesian method which extracts the sky location, frequency, frequency derivative and signal to noise ratio of a source associated with the frequency evolution returned by the SOAP algorithm. This has the aim of limiting the size of the parameter space for a more sensitive fully coherent follow up search. We tested this approach on 200 simulations in Gaussian noise, generating posterior distributions for the parameters described above. In 90\% of these simulations we limit the sky area to 45 deg\^2 with a 95\% confidence contour. However, we find that this contour contains the true parameter only 42\% of the time. We present these results and describe the features and shortcomings of our approach. As mentioned above, we limit the effect of instrumental lines on the SOAP search using machine learning, however we can also identify and mitigate these lines separately before a search is run. We demonstrate how we can use SOAP in a simple configuration to identify instrumental lines. We compare this method to existing line identification tools used in the LIGO collaboration, and find that using the Viterbi statistic SOAP identifies 37\% of the same lines as these methods, where for many of the lines which were not identified, other SOAP outputs do show evidence of a line. With further investigation, we expect to identify many more lines in common with existing methods. As well as these common lines, the SOAP algorithm returned 150 more 0.1 Hz wide bands which potentially contain an instrumental line and did not appear on LIGO line-lists.},

  abstract = {A network of three or more gravitational wave detectors simultaneously taking data is required to generate a well-localized sky map for gravitational wave sources, such as GW170817. Local seismic disturbances often cause the LIGO and Virgo detectors to lose light resonance in one or more of their component optic cavities, and the affected detector is unable to take data until resonance is recovered. In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to gain insight into the predictive behavior of the LIGO detector optic cavities during the second LIGO\textendash Virgo observing run. We identify a minimal set of optic cavity control signals and data features which capture interferometer behavior leading to a loss of light resonance, or lockloss. We use these channels to accurately distinguish between lockloss events and quiet interferometer operating times via both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. This analysis yields new insights into how components of the LIGO detectors contribute to lockloss events, which could inform detector commissioning efforts to mitigate the associated loss of uptime. Particularly, we find that the state of the component optical cavities is a better predictor of loss of lock than ground motion trends. We report prediction accuracies of 98\% for times just prior to lock loss, and 90\% for times up to 30 s prior to lockloss, which shows promise for this method to be applied in near-real time to trigger preventative detector state changes. This method can be extended to target other auxiliary subsystems or times of interest, such as transient noise or loss in detector sensitivity. Application of these techniques during the third LIGO\textendash Virgo observing run and beyond would maximize the potential of the global detector network for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves.},

In this work, we employ Gaussian processes (GP) algorithm to perform a joint analysis by using the geometrical cosmological probes such as Cosmic chronometers, Supernova Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the H0LiCOW lenses sample to infer a reconstruction of the coupling function between the dark components in a general framework, where the DE can assume a dynamical character via its equation of state. In addition to the joint analysis with these data, we simulate a catalog with standard siren events from binary neutron star mergers, within the sensitivity predicted by the Einstein Telescope, to reconstruct the dark sector coupling with more accuracy in a robust way. We find that the particular case, where w = -1 is fixed on the DE nature, has a statistical preference for an interaction in the dark sector at late times. In the general case, where w(z) is analyzed, we find no evidence for such dark coupling, and the predictions are compatible with the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm. When the mock events of the standard sirens are considered to improve the kernel in GP predictions, we find preference for an interaction in the dark sector at late times.},

Gravitational-wave detectors are sensitive to a variety of disturbances of non-astrophysical origin with characteristic frequencies in the instrument band of sensitivity. Removing non-astrophysical artifacts that corrupt the data stream is crucial for increasing the number and statistical significance of gravitational-wave detections and enabling refined astrophysical interpretations of the data. Machine learning has proved to be a powerful tool for analysis of massive quantities of complex data in astronomy and related fields of study. We present two machine learning methods, based on random forest and genetic programming algorithms, that can be used to determine the origin of non-astrophysical transients in the LIGO detectors. We use two classes of transients with known instrumental origin that were identified during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO to show that the algorithms can successfully identify the origin of non-astrophysical transients in real interferometric data and thus assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances in gravitational-wave searches. While the datasets described in this paper are specific to LIGO, and the exact procedures employed were unique to the same, the random forest and genetic programming code bases and means by which they were applied as a dual machine learning approach are completely portable to any number of instruments in which noise is believed to be generated through mechanical couplings, the source of which is not yet discovered.},

Searches for gravitational-wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherent WaveBurst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors.},

The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present LIGO/Virgo, and future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.},

The first Gravitational Wave (GW) detection (GW150914) was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) on September 14, 2015. Furthermore, the proof of the existence of GWs had countless implications from Stellar Evolution to General Relativity. Gravitational waves detection requires multiple filters and the filtered data has to be studied intensively to come to conclusions on whether the data is a just a glitch or an actual gravitational wave detection. However, with the use of Deep Filtering the process is simplified heavily, as it reduces the level of filtering greatly, and the output is definitive and binary. This technique, Deep Filtering, uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained by a composite of real LIGO noise, and injections of GW waveform templates. The CNN effectively uses classification to differentiate weak GW time series from non-gaussian noise from glitches in the LIGO time-series. The model's sensitivity is higher than all prior studies in this field, when making real-time detections of GWs at an extremely low SNR, while still being less computationally expensive.},

  abstract = {Astronomy with gravitational-wave observations is now a reality. Much of the theoretical research in this field falls under three broad themes: the mathematical description and physical understanding of gravitational radiation and its effects; the construction of accurate and computationally efficient waveform models for astrophysical sources; and the improved statistical analysis of noisy data from interferometric detectors, so as to extract and characterise source signals. The doctoral thesis presented in this dissertation is an investigation of various topics across these themes. Under the first theme, we examine the direct interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic fields in a self-contained theoretical study; this is done with a view to understanding the observational implications for highly energetic astrophysical events that radiate in both the gravitational and electromagnetic sectors. We then delve into the second theme of source modelling by developing and implementing an improved waveform model for the extreme-mass-ratio inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into supermassive black holes, which are an important class of source for future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Two separate topics are explored under the third theme of data analysis. We begin with the procedure of searching for gravitational-wave signals in detector data, and propose several combinatorial compression schemes for the large banks of waveform templates that are matched against putative signals, before studying the usefulness of these schemes for accelerating searches. After a gravitational-wave source is detected, the follow-up process is to measure its parameters in detail from the data; this is addressed as we apply the machine-learning technique of Gaussian process regression to gravitational-wave data analysis, and in particular to the formidable problem of parameter estimation for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in gravitational wave astronomy is identifying weak signals in the presence of non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. The separation of gravitational wave signals from noise requires good models for both. When accurate signal models are available, such as for binary Neutron star systems, it is possible to make robust detection statements even when the noise is poorly understood. In contrast, searches for `un-modeled' transient signals are strongly impacted by the methods used to characterize the noise. Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet\textendash Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model.},

In this paper we address both the problem of identifying the noise power spectral density of interferometric detectors by parametric techniques and the problem of the whitening procedure of the sequence of data. We will concentrate the study on a power spectral density like that of the Italian-French detector VIRGO and we show that with a reasonable number of parameters we succeed in modelling a spectrum like the theoretical one of VIRGO, reproducing all of its features. We also propose the use of adaptive techniques to identify and to whiten the data of interferometric detectors on-line. We analyse the behaviour of the adaptive techniques in the field of stochastic gradient and in the least-squares filters. As a result, we find that the least-squares lattice filter is the best among those we have analysed. It succeeds optimally in following all the peaks of the noise power spectrum, and one of its outputs is the whitened part of the spectrum. Besides, the fast convergence of this algorithm, it lets us follow the slow non-stationarity of the noise. These procedures could be used to whiten the overall power spectrum or only some region of it. The advantage of the techniques we propose is that they do not require a~priori knowledge of the noise power spectrum to be analysed. Moreover, the adaptive techniques let us identify and remove the spectral line, without building any physical model of the source that produced it.},

These glitches increase the rate at which random coincidences occur, which reduces the significance of identified gravitational-wave events. The presence of these transients has precipitated extensive work to establish that observed gravitational wave events are astrophysical in nature. We discuss the response of the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from stellar mass binaries to various common glitches that were observed during advanced LIGO's first and second observing runs. We show how these transients can mimic waveforms from compact binary coalescences and quantify the likelihood that a given class of glitches will create a trigger in the search pipeline. We explore the specific waveform parameters that are most similar to different glitch classes and demonstrate how knowledge of these similarities can be used when evaluating the significance of gravitational-wave candidates.},

This deep learning method is an extension of the Deep Filtering method used by George and Huerta (2017) for multi-inputs of network detectors. Simulated coincident time series data sets in advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors are analyzed for estimating source luminosity distance and sky location. As a classifier, our deep neural network (DNN) can effectively recognize the presence of GW signals when the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of network detectors {$\geq$} 9. As a predictor, it can also effectively estimate the corresponding source space parameters, including the luminosity distance D, right ascension {$\alpha$}, and declination {$\delta$} of the compact binary star mergers. When the SNR of the network detectors is greater than 8, their relative errors are all less than 23\%. Our results demonstrate that Deep Filtering can process coincident GW time series inputs and perform effective classification and multiple space parameter estimation. Furthermore, we compare the results obtained from one, two, and three network detectors; these results reveal that a larger number of network detectors results in a better source location.},

Low-mass black holes are interesting because they could form in the aftermath of the coalescence of two neutron stars, from the collapse of massive stars, from matter overdensities in the primordial Universe, or as the outcome of the interaction between neutron stars and dark matter. Gravitational waves carry the imprint of the internal composition of neutron stars via the so-called tidal deformability parameter, which depends on the stellar equation of state and is equal to zero for black holes. We present a new data analysis strategy powered by Bayesian inference and machine learning to identify mixed binaries, hence low-mass black holes, using the distribution of the tidal deformability parameter inferred from gravitational-wave observations.},

Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched-filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time.},

  abstract = {A KL-divergence objective of the joint distribution of data and labels allows to unify supervised learning, VAEs and semi-supervised learning under one umbrella of variational inference. This viewpoint has several advantages. For VAEs, it clarifies the interpretation of encoder and decoder parts. For supervised learning, it re-iterates that the training procedure approximates the true posterior over labels and can always be viewed as approximate likelihood-free inference. This is typically not discussed, even though the derivation is well-known in the literature. In the context of semi-supervised learning it motivates an extended supervised scheme which allows to calculate a goodness-of-fit p-value using posterior predictive simulations. Flow-based networks with a standard normal base distribution are crucial. We discuss how they allow to rigorously define coverage for arbitrary joint posteriors on {$\mathbb{R}^n$} \texttimes{} {$\mathmit{S}^m$}, which encompasses posteriors over directions. Finally, systematic uncertainties are naturally included in the variational viewpoint. With the three ingredients of (1) systematics, (2) coverage and (3) goodness-of-fit, flow-based neural networks have the potential to replace a large part of the statistical toolbox of the contemporary high-energy physicist.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for rapid Bayesian analysis that combines the benefits of nested sampling and artificial neural networks (NNs). The blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference (BAMBI) algorithm implements the MultiNest package for nested sampling as well as the training of an artificial NN to learn the likelihood function. In the case of computationally expensive likelihoods, this allows the substitution of a much more rapid approximation in order to increase significantly the speed of the analysis. We begin by demonstrating, with a few toy examples, the ability of an NN to learn complicated likelihood surfaces. BAMBI's ability to decrease running time for Bayesian inference is then demonstrated in the context of estimating cosmological parameters from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other observations. We show that valuable speed increases are achieved in addition to obtaining NNs trained on the likelihood functions for the different model and data combinations. These NNs can then be used for an even faster follow-up analysis using the same likelihood and different priors. This is a fully general algorithm that can be applied, without any pre-processing, to other problems with computationally expensive likelihood functions.},

  abstract = {This thesis concerns the use of observations of gravitational waves as tools for astronomy and fundamental physics. Gravitational waves are small ripples in spacetime produced by rapidly accelerating masses; their existence has been predicted for almost 100 years, but the first direct evidence of their existence came only very recently with the announcement in February 2016 of the detection by the LIGO and VIRGO collaborations. Part I of this thesis presents an introduction to gravitational wave astronomy, including a detailed discussion of a wide range of gravitational wave sources, their signal morphologies, and the experimental detectors used to observe them. Part II of this thesis concerns a particular data analysis problem which often arises when trying to infer the source properties from a gravitational wave observation. The use of an inaccurate signal model can cause significant systematic errors in the inferred source parameters. The work in this section concerns a proposed technique, called the Gaussian process marginalised likelihood, for overcoming this problem. Part III of this thesis concerns the possibility of testing if the gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole conforms to the predictions of general relativity and the cosmic censorship hypothesis. It is expected that the gravitational field should be well described by the famous Kerr solution. Two approaches for testing this hypothesis are considered; one using X-ray observations and one using gravitational waves. The results from these two approaches are compared and contrasted. Finally, the conclusions and a discussion of future prospects are presented in part IV of this thesis.},

We evaluate our models on problems where conservation of energy is important, including the two-body problem and pixel observations of a pendulum. Our model trains faster and generalizes better than a regular neural network. An interesting side effect is that our model is perfectly reversible in time.},

  abstract = {The field of transient astronomy has seen a revolution with the first gravitational-wave detections and the arrival of multi-messenger observations they enabled. Transformed by the first detection of binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers, computational demands in gravitational-wave astronomy are expected to grow by at least a factor of two over the next five years as the global network of kilometer-scale interferometers are brought to design sensitivity. With the increase in detector sensitivity, real-time delivery of gravitational-wave alerts will become increasingly important as an enabler of multi-messenger followup. In this work, we report a novel implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time gravitational-wave data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This is accomplished using a generic Inference-as-a-Service model that is capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. Our implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private (dedicated) as-a-service computing. Based on our results, we propose a paradigm shift in low-latency and offline computing in gravitational-wave astronomy. Such a shift can address key challenges in peak-usage, scalability and reliability, and provide a data analysis platform particularly optimized for deep learning applications. The achieved sub-millisecond scale latency will also be relevant for any machine learning-based real-time control systems that may be invoked in the operation of near-future and next generation ground-based laser interferometers, as well as the front-end collection, distribution and processing of data from such instruments.},

Effectively, this is a novel approach to determining the scaling relation between a cluster's Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal and mass. The deep-learning algorithm used is mResUNet, which is a modified feed-forward deep-learning algorithm that broadly combines residual learning, convolution layers with different dilation rates, image regression activation, and a U-Net framework. We train and test the deep-learning model using simulated images of the microwave sky that include signals from the cosmic microwave background, dusty and radio galaxies, and instrumental noise as well as the cluster's own SZ signal. The simulated cluster sample covers the mass range 1~\texttimes ~1014 M{$\odot~<~$}M200c~{$<~$}8~\texttimes ~1014 M{$\odot$} at z~=~0.7. The trained model estimates the cluster masses with a 1{$\sigma$} uncertainty {$\Delta$}M/M~{$\leq~$}0.2, consistent with the input scatter on the SZ signal of 20\%. We verify that the model works for realistic SZ profiles even when trained on azimuthally symmetric SZ profiles by using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulations.},

As AI continues to evolve into a computing paradigm endowed with statistical and mathematical rigor, it has become apparent that single-GPU solutions for training, validation, and testing are no longer sufficient for computational grand challenges brought about by scientific facilities that produce data at a rate and volume that outstrip the computing capabilities of available cyberinfrastructure platforms.

We find classification accuracies, for a single detector, of over {$\sim$} 95\,\% for both 1D and 2D CNN pipelines.

  abstract = {The scale of ongoing and future electromagnetic surveys pose formidable challenges to classify astronomical objects. Pioneering efforts on this front include citizen science campaigns adopted by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). SDSS datasets have been recently used to train neural network models to classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that overlap the footprint of both surveys. Herein, we demonstrate that knowledge from deep learning algorithms, pre-trained with real-object images, can be transferred to classify galaxies that overlap both SDSS and DES surveys, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy {$\greaterequivlnt$}99.6\%. We demonstrate that this process can be completed within just eight minutes using distributed training. While this represents a significant step towards the classification of DES galaxies that overlap previous surveys, we need to initiate the characterization of unlabelled DES galaxies in new regions of parameter space. To accelerate this program, we use our neural network classifier to label over ten thousand unlabelled DES galaxies, which do not overlap previous surveys. Furthermore, we use our neural network model as a feature extractor for unsupervised clustering and find that unlabelled DES images can be grouped together in two distinct galaxy classes based on their morphology, which provides a heuristic check that the learning is successfully transferred to the classification of unlabelled DES images. We conclude by showing that these newly labelled datasets can be combined with unsupervised recursive training to create large-scale DES galaxy catalogs in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era.},

  abstract = {The spin distribution of binary black hole mergers contains key information concerning the formation channels of these objects, and the astrophysical environments where they form, evolve and coalesce. To quantify the suitability of deep learning to estimate the individual spins, effective spin and mass-ratio of quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers, we introduce a modified version of WaveNet trained with a novel optimization scheme that incorporates general relativistic constraints of the spin properties of astrophysical black holes. The neural network model is trained, validated and tested with 1.5 million {$\mathscr{l}$}=|m|=2 waveforms generated within the regime of validity of NRHybSur3dq8, i.e., mass-ratios q{$\leq$}8 and individual black hole spins |s|\{1,2\}z{$\leq$}0.8. To reduce time-to-insight, we deployed a distributed training algorithm at the IBM Power9 Hardware-Accelerated Learning cluster at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications to reduce the training stage from 1 month, using a single V100 NVIDIA GPU, to 12.4 hours using 64 V100 NVIDIA GPUs. We have also fully trained this model using 1536 V100 GPUs (256 nodes) in the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy within just 1.2 hours. Using this neural network model, we quantify how accurately we can infer the astrophysical parameters of black hole mergers in the absence of noise. We do this by computing the overlap between waveforms in the testing data set and the corresponding signals whose mass-ratio and individual spins are predicted by our neural network. We find that the convergence of high performance computing and physics-inspired optimization algorithms enable an accurate reconstruction of the mass-ratio and individual spins of binary black hole mergers across the parameter space under consideration. This is a significant step towards an informed utilization of physics-inspired deep learning models to reconstruct the spin distribution of binary black hole mergers in realistic detection scenarios.},

The structure of our deep Bayseian machine adopts the conditional variational autoencoder scheme by conditioning both the gravitational wave strains and the variations of amplitude spectral density of the detector noise. We show that our deep Bayesian machine is capable of yielding the posteriors compatible with the ones from the nest sampling method, and of fighting against the noise outliers. We also apply our deep Bayesian machine to the LIGO/Virgo O3 events, and find that conditioning detector noise to fight against its drifting is relevant for the events with medium signal-to-noise ratios.},

Because of the expected low signal to noise ratio of LIGO data and incomplete knowledge of gravitational waveforms, evolutionary computing is an excellent candidate for LIGO data analysis studies. Using the evolutionary computing methods of genetic algorithms and genetic programming, we have developed, as a proof of principle, search algorithms that are effective at finding sine-gaussian signals hidden in noise while maintaining a small false alarm rate. Because we used realistic LIGO noise as a training ground, the algorithms we have evolved should be well suited to detecting signals in actual LIGO data, as well as in simulated noise. These algorithms have continuously improved during the five days of their evolution and are expected to improve further the more they are evolved. The top performing algorithms from generation 100 and 199 were benchmarked using gaussian white noise to illustrate their performance and the improvement over 100 generations.},

The method uses learned dictionaries (a supervised machine learning algorithm) for signal denoising, and untrained dictionaries for the final sparse reconstruction and classification. We use a data set of 3000 simulated glitches of three different waveform morphologies, comprising 1000 glitches per morphology. These data are embedded in non-white Gaussian noise to simulate the background noise of advanced LIGO in its broadband configuration. Our classification method yields a 96\% accuracy for a large range of initial parameters, showing that learned dictionaries are an interesting approach for glitch classification. This work constitutes a preliminary step before assessing the performance of dictionary-learning methods with actual detector glitches.},

The convolutional neural networks typically have alternating convolutional layers and max pooling layers, followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We increase the stride in the max pooling layer by 1, followed by a dropout layer to alleviate overfitting in the original model. We find that these optimizations can effectively increase the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for various tests on the same dataset.},

The ML-enhanced cWB search identifies five additional GW candidate events from the catalog that were previously missed by the standard cWB search. Moreover, we identify three marginal candidate events not listed in GWTC-3. For simulated events distributed uniformly in a fiducial volume, we improve the detection efficiency with respect to the standard cWB search by approximately 20\% for both stellar-mass and intermediate mass black hole binary mergers, detected with a false-alarm rate less than 1 yr{$^{-1}$}. We show the robustness of the ML-enhanced search for detection of generic BBH signals by reporting increased sensitivity to the spin-precessing and eccentric BBH events as compared to the standard cWB search. Furthermore, we compare the improvement of the ML-enhanced cWB search for different detector networks.},

  abstract = {Excess transient noise artifacts, or glitches impact the data quality of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and impair the detection of signals produced by astrophysical sources. Mitigation of glitches is crucial for improving GW signal detectability. However, glitches are the product of short-lived linear and non-linear couplings among the interrelated detector-control systems that include optic alignment systems and mitigation of seismic disturbances, generally making it difficult to model noise couplings. Hence, typically time periods containing glitches are vetoed to mitigate the effect of glitches in GW searches at the cost of reduction of the analyzable data. To increase the available data period and improve the detectability for both model and unmodeled GW signals, we present a new machine learning based method which uses on-site sensors/system-controls monitoring the instrumental and environmental conditions to model noise couplings and subtract glitches in GW detector data. We find that our method reduces 20-70\% of the excess power in the data due to glitches. By injecting software simulated signals into the data and recovering them with one of the unmodeled GW detection pipelines, we address the robustness of the glitch-reduction technique to efficiently remove glitches with no unintended effects on GW signals.},

  abstract = {Among the astrophysical sources in the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Advanced Virgo detectors' frequency band are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational waves. Searches for these continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long stretches of data in a matched-filter framework e.g. the -statistic method. In an all-sky search for a priori unknown sources, a large number of templates are matched against the data using a pre-defined grid of variables (the gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates), subsequently producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the grid points at which the signal reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is encoded in the multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first work of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the distributions. We consider three basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency detector artifact (`stationary line'), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and 2D versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained and tested on a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these implementations correctly classify the instances of data at various signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing concept generalization i.e. satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies. In addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and possible applications of these implementations.},

The dataset is a collection of one dimensional time series arrays, corresponding to simulated gravitational waveforms emitted by a black hole binary, and labelled by the masses of the two black holes. In addition, white Gaussian noise is added to the arrays, to simulate a signal detection in the presence of noise. A convolutional neural network is trained to infer the output labels in the presence of noise, and the resulting model generalizes over many order of magnitudes in the noise level. From the results I argue that the hidden layers of the model succesfully denoise the signals before the inference step. The entire code is implemeted in the form of a Python module, and the neural network is written in PyTorch. The training of the network is speeded up using a single GPU, and I report about efforts to improve the scaling of the training time with respect to the size of the training sample.},

As the advanced detectors are reaching sensitivity levels that allow for multiple detections of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources it is crucial to achieve a fast and accurate characterization of non-astrophysical transient noise shortly after it occurs in the detectors. Previously we presented three methods for the classification of transient noise sources. They are Principal Component Analysis for Transients (PCAT), Principal Component LALInference Burst (PC-LIB) and Wavelet Detection Filter with Machine Learning (WDF-ML). In this study we carry out the first performance tests of these algorithms on gravitational-wave data from the Advanced LIGO detectors. We use the data taken between the 3rd of June 2015 and the 14th of June 2015 during the 7th engineering run (ER7), and outline the improvements made to increase the performance and lower the latency of the algorithms on real data. This work provides an important test for understanding the performance of these methods on real, non stationary data in preparation for the second advanced gravitational-wave detector observation run, planned for later this year. We show that all methods can classify transients in non stationary data with a high level of accuracy and show the benefits of using multiple classifiers.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {A hundred years after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, the first direct detection was made from gravitational waves emitted by a binary black hole system. Other potential sources for an advanced gravitational-wave detector network include core-collapse supernovae. Due to complicated simulations of the physics involved in core-collapse supernovae, the exact waveform of a core-collapse supernova signal is unknown. A detection of a core-collapse supernova signal is challenging, as noise of non-astrophysical origin contaminates the science data taken by the advanced detectors. Noise transients in the detectors limit the false alarm rate of astrophysical detections, and could potentially mimic a core-collapse supernova signal. They can reduce the duty cycle of the detectors, which is particularly harmful for core-collapse supernovae detections due to their low event rate. Prompt characterization of instrumental and environmental noise transients will be critical for improving the sensitivity of the advanced detectors during observing runs. During the science runs of the initial gravitational-wave detectors, noise transients were manually classified by visually examining the time-frequency scan of each event. Here, we present a Bayesian model selection algorithm designed for the automatic classification of noise transients in advanced gravitational-wave detectors. The algorithm is tested on simulated data sets and real non-Gaussian, non-stationary Advanced LIGO noise, and we demonstrate the ability to automatically classify transients by frequency, SNR and waveform morphology. A classification of noise transients as data is taken can lead to an improvement in data quality during an observing run and determine their origin. In this thesis, we show how Bayesian model selection can be used to determine if a core-collapse supernova candidate gravitational-wave signal is a noise transient, a core-collapse supernova signal or other astrophysical transient. If the signal is a core-collapse supernova detection, we show how the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism can be determined using a combination of principal component analysis and Bayesian model selection. We use the latest three-dimensional simulations of gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae exploding via neutrino-driven convection and rapidly-rotating core-collapse. We show that with an advanced detector network, we can determine if the core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism is neutrino-driven convection for sources in our Galaxy, and rapidly-rotating core collapse for sources out to the Large Magellanic Cloud.},

Multiple sub-populations of compact binaries representing different evolutionary scenarios may be present amongst sources detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. In addition to hierarchical modelling, unmodelled methods can aid in determining the number of sub-populations and their properties. In this paper, we apply Gaussian mixture model clustering to 1000 simulated gravitational-wave compact binary sources from a mixture of five sub-populations. Using both mass and spin as input parameters, we determine how many binary detections are needed to accurately determine the number of sub-populations and their mass and spin distributions. In the most difficult case that we consider, where two sub-populations have identical mass distributions but differ in their spin, which is poorly constrained by gravitational-wave detections, we find that {$\sim$}400 detections are needed before we can identify the correct number of sub-populations.},

The characterization of these detectors is a primary task in order to recognize the main sources of noise and optimize the sensitivity of interferometers. Glitches are transient noise events that can impact the data quality of the interferometers and their classification is an important task for detector characterization. Deep learning techniques are a promising tool for the recognition and classification of glitches. We present a classification pipeline that exploits convolutional neural networks to classify glitches starting from their time-frequency evolution represented as images. We evaluated the classification accuracy on simulated glitches, showing that the proposed algorithm can automatically classify glitches on very fast timescales and with high accuracy, thus providing a promising tool for online detector characterization.},

We study the performance using a suitable {$\mathscr{C}$}r variable in order to estimate the performance regarding the CMB power spectrum recovery. We consider a test set where one point source is masked out in each sky patch with a 1.83 \texttimes{} 1.83 squared degree extension, which, in our gridding, corresponds to 64 \texttimes{} 64 pixels. The GAN is optimized for estimating performance on Planck 2018 total intensity simulations. The training makes the GAN effective in reconstructing a masking corresponding to about 1500 pixels with 1\% error down to angular scales corresponding to about 5 arcminutes. Finally, we show that GAN is able to mimic PDF and number density of peaks for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data with less than 0.5\% relative error.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves are now observed routinely. Therefore, data analysis has to keep up with ever improving detectors. One relatively new tool to search for gravitational wave signals in detector data are machine learning algorithms that utilize deep neuralnnetworks. The first successful application was able to differentiate time series strain data that contains a gravitational wave from a binary black hole merger from data that consists purely of noise. This work expands the analysis to signals from binary neutron star mergers, where a rapid detection is most valuable, as electromagnetic counterparts might otherwise be missed or not observed for long enough. We showcase many different architecture, discuss what choices improved the sensitivity of our search and introduce a new multi-rate approach. We find that the final algorithm gives state of the art performance in comparison to other search pipelines that use deep neural networks. On the other hand we also conclude that our analysis is not yet able to achieve sensitivities that are on par with template based searches. We report our results at false alarm rates down to  30 samples/month which has not been tested by other neural network algorithms. We hope to provide information about useful architectural choices and improve our algorithm in the future to achieve sensitivities and false alarm rates that rival matched filtering based approaches on.},

Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values.

Given the restricted telescope time, the creation of prioritized lists of the many identified candidates becomes mandatory. Towards this end, we use astrorapid, a multiband photometric light-curve classifier, to differentiate between kilonovae, supernovae, and other possible transients. We demonstrate our method on the photometric observations of real events. In addition, the classification performance is tested on simulated light curves, both ideally and realistically sampled. We show that after only a few days of observations of an astronomical object, it is possible to rule out candidates as supernovae and other known transients.},

We describe a practical, efficient, semi-coherent search based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking scheme, solved by the Viterbi algorithm, combined with a maximum likelihood matched filter, the {$\mathmit{F}$}-statistic. The scheme is well suited to analyzing data from advanced detectors like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO). It can track rapid phase evolution from secular stellar braking and stochastic timing noise torques simultaneously without searching second- and higher-order derivatives of the signal frequency, providing an economical alternative to stack-slide-based semi-coherent algorithms. One implementation tracks the signal frequency alone. A second implementation tracks the signal frequency and its first time derivative. It improves the sensitivity by a factor of a few upon the first implementation, but the cost increases by two to three orders of magnitude.},

It is shown that frequency tracking by hidden Markov model (HMM) methods can be combined with existing maximum likelihood coherent matched filters like the F-statistic to surmount some of the challenges raised by spin wandering. Specifically it is found that, for an isolated, biaxial rotor whose spin frequency walks randomly, HMM tracking of the F-statistic output from coherent segments with duration T\textsubscript{d}rift = 10d over a total observation time of T\textsubscript{o}bs = 1yr can detect signals with wave strains h0 \textquestiondown{} 2e-26 at a noise level characteristic of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO). For a biaxial rotor with randomly walking spin in a binary orbit, whose orbital period and semi-major axis are known approximately from electromagnetic observations, HMM tracking of the Bessel-weighted F-statistic output can detect signals with h0 \textquestiondown{} 8e-26. An efficient, recursive, HMM solver based on the Viterbi algorithm is demonstrated, which requires 10{$^3$} CPU-hours for a typical, broadband (0.5-kHz) search for the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, including generation of the relevant F-statistic input. In a "realistic" observational scenario, Viterbi tracking successfully detects 41 out of 50 synthetic signals without spin wandering in Stage I of the Scorpius X-1 Mock Data Challenge convened by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration down to a wave strain of h0 = 1.1e-25, recovering the frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of \textexclamdown = 4.3e-3 Hz.},

  abstract = {Many astronomical surveys are limited by the brightness of the sources, and gravitational-wave searches are no exception. The detectability of gravitational waves from merging binaries is affected by the mass and spin of the constituent compact objects. To perform unbiased inference on the distribution of compact binaries, it is necessary to account for this selection effect, which is known as Malmquist bias. Since systematic error from selection effects grows with the number of events, it will be increasingly important over the coming years to accurately estimate the observational selection function for gravitational-wave astronomy. We employ density estimation methods to accurately and efficiently compute the compact binary coalescence selection function. We introduce a simple pre-processing method, which significantly reduces the complexity of the required machine-learning models. We demonstrate that our method has smaller statistical errors at comparable computational cost than the method currently most widely used allowing us to probe narrower distributions of spin magnitudes. The currently used method leaves 10\%\textendash 50\% of the interesting black hole spin models inaccessible; our new method can probe {$>$}99\% of the models and has a lower uncertainty for {$>$}80\% of the models.},

  abstract = {Observations of planets beyond our solar system (exoplanets) yield uncertain orbital parameters. Particularly in compact multiplanet systems, a significant fraction of observationally inferred orbital configurations can lead to planetary collisions on timescales that are short compared with the age of the system. Rejection of these unphysical solutions can thus sharpen our view of exoplanetary orbital architectures. Long-term stability determination is currently performed through direct orbital integrations. However, this approach is computationally prohibitive for application to the full exoplanet sample. By speeding up this process by up to five orders of magnitude, we enable precise exoplanet characterization of compact multiplanet systems and our ability to examine the stability properties of the multiplanet exoplanet sample as a whole.We combine analytical understanding of resonant dynamics in two-planet systems with machine-learning techniques to train a model capable of robustly classifying stability in compact multiplanet systems over long timescales of 109 orbits. Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured in integrations of the first 104 orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to 105 over full simulations. This computationally opens up the stability-constrained characterization of multiplanet systems. Our model, trained on {$\sim$}100,000 three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit-duration measurements for small planets and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit-timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet-detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints [S. Hadden, T. Barclay, M. J. Payne, M. J. Holman, Astrophys. J. 158, 146 (2019)], SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multiplanet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.July 21, 2021: The author line has been updated.},

This issue is especially relevant for transient gravitational waves searches with a robust eyes wide open approach, the so called all-sky burst searches. Here we show how signal classification methods inspired by broad astrophysical characteristics can be implemented in all-sky burst searches preserving their generality. In our case study, we apply a multivariate analyses based on artificial neural networks to classify waves emitted in compact binary coalescences. We enhance by orders of magnitude the significance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the noise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of noise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We also show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be performed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in discriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future observations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing recoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of the flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient gravitational waves.},

The results show that the ANN performs excellently on best-fit values and errors of parameters, as well as correlations between parameters when compared with that of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Besides, for a well-trained ANN model, it is capable of estimating parameters for multiple experiments that have different precisions, which can greatly reduce the consumption of time and computing resources for parameter inference. Furthermore, we extend the ANN to a multibranch network to achieve a joint constraint on parameters. We test the multibranch network using the simulated temperature and polarization power spectra of the CMB, Type Ia supernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillations and almost obtain the same results as the MCMC method. Therefore, we propose that the ANN can provide an alternative way to accurately and quickly estimate cosmological parameters, and ECoPANN can be applied to the research of cosmology and even other broader scientific fields.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a proof-of-concept experiment that demonstrates that deep learning can successfully be used for production-scale classification of compact star clusters detected in Hubble Space Telescope(HST) ultraviolet-optical imaging of nearby spiral galaxies (\$D\textbackslash lesssim 20\textbackslash, \textbackslash textrm\{Mpc\}\$) in the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)\textendash HST survey. Given the relatively small nature of existing, human-labelled star cluster samples, we transfer the knowledge of state-of-the-art neural network models for real-object recognition to classify star clusters candidates into four morphological classes. We perform a series of experiments to determine the dependence of classification performance on neural network architecture (ResNet18 and VGG19-BN), training data sets curated by either a single expert or three astronomers, and the size of the images used for training. We find that the overall classification accuracies are not significantly affected by these choices. The networks are used to classify star cluster candidates in the PHANGS\textendash HST galaxy NGC 1559, which was not included in the training samples. The resulting prediction accuracies are 70\,per\,cent, 40\,per\,cent, 40\textendash 50\,per\,cent, and 50\textendash 70\,per\,cent for class 1, 2, 3 star clusters, and class 4 non-clusters, respectively. This performance is competitive with consistency achieved in previously published human and automated quantitative classification of star cluster candidate samples (70\textendash 80\,per\,cent, 40\textendash 50\,per\,cent, 40\textendash 50\,per\,cent, and 60\textendash 70\,per\,cent). The methods introduced herein lay the foundations to automate classification for star clusters at scale, and exhibit the need to prepare a standardized data set of human-labelled star cluster classifications, agreed upon by a full range of experts in the field, to further improve the performance of the networks introduced in this study.},

  abstract = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first observing run.},
